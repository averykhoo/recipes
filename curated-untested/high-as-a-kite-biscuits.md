# [High As A Kite Biscuits](http://www.grouprecipes.com/56252/high-as-a-kite-biscuits.html)

* From krumkake
* 10 minutes to make
* Serves 8

These are the biscuits I make for biscuits and gravy.
The trick is to work the dough as little as possible, and if you can get the hang of that, you will have biscuits that
bake up higher than anything you've ever seen.

Ingredients

* 2 cups all-purpose flour
* 1 tablespoon baking powder
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1 tablespoon sugar (you can add more if you want a sweeter biscuit)
* 1.5 cups heavy whipping cream (DO NOT SUBSTITUTE - I've tried! These biscuits will only pop up sky-high if you use
  heavy cream - they were flat and not fluffy inside when I tried half-and-half or whole milk)

How to make it

1. In a medium bowl, stir together all ingredients just until the dough forms a ball and ingredients are moistened.
2. Turn the dough out onto a work surface that is dusted with a very small amount of additional flour.
3. Fold the dough in half and press down with the palms of your hands;
   knead the dough this way for 5 to 7 times more, adding just enough flour to keep the dough from sticking to your
   hands and work surface.
4. Gently press dough out to about 0.75-inch thickness;
   cut dough into 3-inch size rounds (use a cookie cutter or a small juice glass).
5. Spray a baking sheet with cooking spray and place biscuits on it, leaving at least 1-inch between each biscuit.
6. Bake at 480 degrees (yes, a very hot oven!) for about 10 minutes, until golden brown on bottoms and tops.
7. You need to watch them closely at the end so you don't burn the bottoms - they require a hot oven, so don't try to
   reduce the heat.
8. Just keep an eye on them and when the tops are nicely golden brown, the bottoms should be, too.
9. If you forget to check them and you end up burning the bottoms (and I HAVE done this!!), just cut off the bottoms of
   the biscuits and they will be fine to eat!
10. Note: For holidays, try using different cookie cutter shapes, like hearts, holly leaf, etc.
