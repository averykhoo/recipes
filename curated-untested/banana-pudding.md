The best quick southern banana pudding comes together in a snap and uses Cool Whip to make the pudding airy and lightâ€”a perfect complement to fresh bananas and crunchy vanilla wafers.

**Author:** Richelle Tucker
**Total Time:** 4 hours and 15 minutes
**Prep Time:** 15 Minutes
**Chill Time:** 4 hours

## Ingredients

*   4-5 Bananas
*   1 box Nilla Wafers
*   1 (3.4 oz) box Jello Vanilla Pudding
*   2 cups of cold whole milk
*   16 oz Cool Whip, divided and thawed

## Instructions

1.  In a large bowl, whisk the pudding mix with two cups of cold milk. Stir until the pudding begins to thicken, about 2 minutes.
2.  Using a flexible spatula, fold in 8 ounces of the Cool Whip into the vanilla pudding. Cover the pudding mixture and refrigerate for 10-15 minutes until the pudding is just set.
3.  While the pudding is in the fridge, peel and slice the bananas into thin rounds and set them aside.
4.  To assemble the banana pudding, start by layering Nilla wafers at the bottom of a casserole dish or trifle bowl, covering the entire surface.
5.  Next, place a layer of banana rounds on top of the vanilla wafers.
6.  Pour a layer of the prepared pudding mixture over the bananas and spread it out evenly with a spatula.
7.  Repeat the layers of wafers, bananas, and pudding until you run out of space or ingredients, making sure the last layer is pudding.
8.  Top the banana pudding with the remaining 8 ounces of Cool Whip, followed by some more Vanilla wafers.
9.  Cover the banana pudding and refrigerate for at least 4 hours.
