## Ingredients

* 6 Tbsp sweetened condensed milk
* ~3/4 cup iced water
* 2-3 Tbsp jell-o instant vanilla pudding mix (must be "instant")
* 1 cup heavy cream
* 250g (8oz) pack of Biscoff Lotus biscuits <- can use less, maybe 200g
* 3-4 ripe bananas, peeled, de-stringed, and sliced

## Directions

1. **Create the pudding base:**
   In a medium bowl, whisk together the sweetened condensed milk, ice, and water until combined.
   Add the instant vanilla pudding mix and continue to whisk until the mixture is smooth and free of lumps.
   Cover the bowl and refrigerate for at least 3-4 hours, or overnight, until the pudding has set and is firm.
2. **Make the whipped cream and fold in the pudding:**
   In a separate large bowl, use an electric mixer or stand mixer to whip the cold heavy cream until stiff peaks form.
   Be careful not to over-whip. Gently fold the chilled pudding mixture into the whipped cream with a spatula
   until they are fully incorporated and no streaks remain.
3. **Assemble and chill:**
   You can layer the pudding mixture, bananas, and about three-quarters of the Biscoff cookies (broken into pieces)
   in a trifle dish or individual bowls, or simply fold them all together.
   Cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours to allow the cookies to soften and the flavors to meld.
4. **Serve:**
   Before serving, garnish the banana pudding with the remaining Biscoff cookies, either whole or crumbled on top.

# (Original) Magnolia's Famous Banana Pudding

SERVES 12-15

> I started making this pudding when I was in my early twenties and cooking at a Tex-Mex restaurant and bar.
> Customers loved it, so when we opened the bakery many years later, it seemed like a great idea to serve it there.
> It remains the second most popular dessert (after the cupcakes) at the bakery.

## Ingredients

* One 14-ounce can sweetened condensed milk
* 1Â½ cups ice-cold water
* One 3.4-ounce package instant vanilla pudding mix (preferably Jell-O brand)
* 3 cups heavy cream
* One 12-ounce box Nabisco Nilla Wafers (no substitutions!)
* 4 cups sliced ripe bananas

## Directions

1. In a small bowl, on the medium speed of an electric mixer,
   beat together the sweetened condensed milk and water until well combined, about 1 minute.
   Add the pudding mix and beat well, about 2 minutes more.
   Cover and refrigerate for 3-4 hours or overnight, before continuing.
   It is very important to allow the proper amount of time for the pudding mixture to set.

2. In a large bowl, on the medium speed of an electric mixer, whip the heavy cream until stiff peaks form.
   Gently fold the pudding mixture into the whipped cream until well blended and no streaks of pudding remain.

3. To assemble the dessert, select a large, wide bowl (preferably glass) with a 4-5 quart capacity.
   Arrange one-third of the wafers to cover the bottom of the bowl, overlapping if necessary,
   then one-third of the bananas and one-third of the pudding.
   Repeat the layering twice more, garnishing with additional wafers or wafer crumbs on the top layer of the pudding.
   Cover tightly with plastic wrap and allow to chill in the refrigerator for 4 hours--or up to 8 hours,
   but no longer!--before serving.
