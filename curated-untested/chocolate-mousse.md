* 4-6 servings

My followers know I love chocolate very much: Chocolate cakes, chocolate cookies and everything related to chocolate.
In a city where chocolate is revered as an art form, it's as if it “flows” in the Seine River!
One of my favorite desserts is chocolate mousse, which I discovered far before my culinary journey in Paris.

Actually, the first time I tasted it was in my childhood when the chocolate mousse was sold at the neighborhood
supermarket in plastic cups.
After one taste, I felt like I won the lottery! Over the years, I have tried many chocolate mousse recipes, but this
recipe is my favorite.
It is very simple to make.
With an airy and light texture, it is a dessert that leaves you wanting a second helping.
You'll be asking for more!
