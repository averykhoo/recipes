Ingredients
Makes: 12 fruity buns
225g self-raising flour
100g cold butter or margarine, cubed
100g caster sugar
1 medium egg
1 tablespoon milk
50g fruit jam
Method
Prep:20min  ›  Cook:10min  ›  Ready in:30min 
Preheat the oven to 200 C / Gas 6. Grease two baking trays and sprinkle them with flour. Spread the flour by tipping the trays from side to side.
Sift the flour into a large mixing bowl then add the cold cubed butter.
Rub the butter into the flour with your fingers, until the mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs. Stir in the sugar.
Break the egg into a small bowl and add the milk. Whisk them together then stir them into the breadcrumb mixture in the other bowl.
Sprinkle a clean surface with some flour. Press the mixture to make a firm ball, then transfer to your floured surface.
Cut the ball into 12 (or however many you can manage) even-sized pieces.
Flatten each piece into a round shape and spread them out onto the baking trays. Make a dent in each bun (either with a cutter or with a knife) and fill each with your chosen jam.
Bake the buns for 10 minutes until risen and golden brown. Transfer each onto a cooling rack and leave them to cool before serving them.
Tip
Leave the jam to cool before eating.
