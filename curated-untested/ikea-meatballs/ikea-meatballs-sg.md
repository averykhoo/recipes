# [Meatballs with Cream Sauce](https://www.ikea.com/ms/en_SG/pdf/restaurant/Meatballs_w_creamsauce.pdf)

Without a doubt, meatballs is the best known of all Swedish dishes, traditionally served with potatoes, lingonberry jam
and cream sauce.
The dish is an unexpected meeting of flavours as the lingonberry sweetness contrasts, yet harmonizes, with the
meatballs, while the cream sauce serves as a neutral “mediator” between the two.

This is what you need (30–40 meatballs, serves 4):

* 250 g minced beef
* 250 g minced pork
* 1 egg
* 200–300 ml cream (or milk) and water
* 2.5 Tbsp fine chopped onion
* 50 ml unsweetened rusk flour
* 2 boiled potatoes, cold
* 4–5 Tbsp butter, margarine or oil
* salt
* white pepper
* (allspice)

This is how you do it:

1. Heat the onion until golden in a couple of tablespoons of lightly browned butter.
2. Mash the potatoes and moisten the rusk flour in a little water.
3. Mix all the ingredients into a smooth farce and flavour generously with salt, white pepper and (optional) finecrushed
   allspice.
4. Shape the farce into round balls and transfer to a floured chopping board, then fry them quite slowly in plenty of
   butter.

This is what you need (cream sauce, serves 4):

* 100 ml double cream
* 200 l water or beef stock
* soy
* salt
* white pepper
* (1 Tbsp white flour)

This is how you do it:

1. Swirl out the pan with a couple of decilitres of boiling water or meat stock.
2. Strain the pan juices and dilute with cream.
3. Thicken with white flour if preferred.
4. Season well, and serve this and the meatballs with freshly boiled potatoes, lingonberry jam, a green salad and salted
   or pickled gherkins.
