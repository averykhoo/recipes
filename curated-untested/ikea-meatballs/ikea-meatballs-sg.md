Without a doubt, meatballs is the best known of all Swedish dishes, traditionally served with potatoes, lingonberry jam
and cream sauce.
The dish is an unexpected meeting of flavours as the lingonberry sweetness contrasts, yet harmonizes, with the
meatballs, while the cream sauce serves as a neutral “mediator” between the two.
