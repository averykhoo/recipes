# [Prize Winning Banana Bread](http://www.grouprecipes.com/32963/prize-winning-banana-bread.html)

* From krumkake
* 45 minutes to make
* Serves 12

This recipe won 1st place at the Nicollet County Fair in 1981 and it stills remains our family favorite for banana
bread.
I've modified it ever so slightly over the years, but the end result remains moist and flavorful.

## Ingredients

* 0.5 cup butter, softened
* 0.25 cup vegetable oil
* 1 cup white sugar
* 0.5 cup brown sugar
* 2 eggs
* 1.5 cups mashed ripe bananas (I use 3 medium well-ripened bananas)
* 0.5 cup sour cream
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* 2 cups flour
* 1 teaspoon baking soda
* 0.5 teaspoon salt
* additional brown sugar for top of batter

## Directions

1. Mix together butter, oil, sugars and eggs.
2. Add mashed bananas, sour cream and vanilla, stirring together well.
3. Mix in flour, baking soda and salt, stirring until it is well blended.
4. Pour into 1 greased large loaf pan or 3 small loaf pans (I always use 3 of the 7 3/8 x 3 5/8 inch loaf pans - I
   think it gives the best results).
5. Sprinkle additional brown sugar generously over top of batter, using your hand to gently pat some of it into the
   batter.
6. Bake at 325 degrees: large loaf pan for about 1 hour, smaller loaves for about 45 minutes.
7. Allow bread to cool in pans for about 20 minutes, then run a sharp knife around the edges, tap the pan on the counter
   several times to release the bread from the bottom of the pan, then invert pan over a wire rack and let the bread
   fall onto the rack to finish cooling completely.
8. Variations and Suggestions: Add any of the following – miniature chocolate chips, toffee bits, shredded coconut,
   chopped pecans or macadamia nuts.
9. Try toasting your banana bread – spread hot toasted bread with butter and even add a sprinkling of cinnamon and sugar
   and some slices of banana, or top with a combination of honey and peanut butter, or spread hot toasted bread with
   some Nutella…the possibilities are endless!
10. Use slices of banana bread to make your French toast.
    Just dust the finished product with some powdered sugar, or a little powdered sugar glaze, or spread on some
    Nutella, and maple syrup is good on it, too…you've gotta try it!
