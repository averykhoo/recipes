Instructions from video:

1. Combine Dry Ingredients: In a large mixing bowl, mix together the flour, sugar, oats, and cornflakes.
2. Melt Wet Ingredients: In a saucepan, melt the butter and golden syrup together.
3. Mix Everything: Pour the melted butter and golden syrup mixture into the bowl with the dry ingredients. Stir until
   everything is well combined. For a chewier flapjack, you can add an extra two tablespoons of golden syrup.
4. Prepare for Baking: Press the mixture into a lightly greased sheet pan. Be careful not to press it down too hard, as
   this can make the flapjacks too crunchy.
5. Bake: Bake in the oven for about 20 minutes until golden brown. The top should be soft when it comes out.
6. Cut While Warm: Let the flapjacks cool for a few minutes after taking them out of the oven. It is important to cut
   them into bars while they are still warm, otherwise, they will crumble and break when you try to cut them cold.
7. Cool Completely: Allow the flapjacks to cool completely in the pan before removing and serving them.
