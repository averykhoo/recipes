#   [Swedish Meatballs](http://www.grouprecipes.com/20899/swedish-meatballs.html) (untested)
*   From krumkake
*   40 minutes to make
*   Serves 6

This was usually served during the holidays in the Scandinavian family I grew up in.
No one ever got my great-grandmother's recipe (it was the usual "little of this, little of that") but this is as close as I've come.
The seasoning really depends on how much allspice and nutmeg flavor you prefer, so play around with it until you find the amount you like.
I tend to go pretty light with it.

Ingredients
*   meatballs
    *   0.5 cup​ unseasoned bread crumbs
    *   1 pound​ ground chuck
    *   0.5 pound​ unseasoned ground pork
    *   0.5 cup​ leftover mashed potatoes
    *   1 egg, beaten
    *   0.5 teaspoon salt
    *   1 teaspoon brown sugar
    *   few dashes of black pepper
    *   0.25 teaspoon allspice
    *   0.25 teaspoon nutmeg
    *   0.125 teaspoon ground cloves
    *   0.125 teaspoon ginger
*   gravy
    *   1 cup​ heavy cream or half-and-half
    *   1 cup​ chicken or beef stock (I prefer stock to broth – more flavor)
*   seasonings, as needed – see directions

How to make it
1.  Put all meatball ingredients into a large bowl.
    I always find it easiest to use your hands to gently "squish" the mixture, blending all ingredients together well.
2.  When well blended, shape into 1” diameter meatballs.
3.  Place about 2 tablespoons butter in a large frying pan; brown the meatballs in the butter, turning to brown all sides.
4.  Cover pan and gently cook over low heat for about 10 minutes, until meat is cooked through.
5.  Remove meatballs from pan and keep warm while you prepare the gravy.
6.  Stir 2 tablespoons of flour into the pan drippings, whisking together well to remove any clumps of flour.
7.  Whisking continually, gradually whisk in heavy cream or half-and-half, and chicken or beef stock
    (either will give you a nice gravy – whatever you have on hand).
8.  Season the gravy to your taste with some salt, pepper and just a dash of allspice
    (if needed – the pan drippings will have the flavors from the meatballs, so it all depends on how much you like the allspice flavor!).
9.  Return meatballs to the gravy and simmer very, very gently for 30 minutes
    (you don’t want to break the cream or half-and-half), stirring often.
10. Taste gravy again and adjust seasoning, if needed
    (it probably won’t be needed, as the simmering will incorporate the flavors from the meatballs into the gravy and it should be fine).
11. This gravy is generally not a thick gravy, but you can thicken more, if desired, with a mixture of cornstarch and water.
12. Serve over egg noodles, rice, mashed potatoes, or just on their own, with lots of bread to sop up the gravy!
