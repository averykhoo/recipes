* Yields 4 Servings

## Ingredients

* 560g baby spinach
* 1 TBSP Butter
* 1 TBSP Flour
* 1/4 Cup Heavy Whipping Cream
* Salt and Pepper

## Directions

1. Stem the Spinach: Pull the stems out of the spinach. As mentioned before, some grocers offer this as an option in the
   bagged salad area.
2. ‘Wash’ the leaves in a bowl of water to loosen any dirt. Repeat if necessary to get all the dirt out. Remove the
   leaves from the water.
3. Drop the leaves into a large pot of boiling, salted water. {4-5 quarts} 【4.73 L】 Cover the pot only until steam
   starts to escape; then uncover at once! Let boil a minute or two, until spinach is wilted and only partially tender.
4. Remove to a large bowl of ice water. This stops the cooking and sets the green color. When it is chilled, remove by
   big handfuls and squeeze out as much water as you can. {Very fun! Like Play-Dough!}
   **This can all be done the day before and kept in a plastic bag in the refrigerator**
5. Briefly saute the spinach in a frying pan with 1 tablespoon of butter, to evaporate the moisture. Stir in 1
   tablespoon of flour and continue to slow saute for about 2 minutes. Remove from heat and blend in 1/4 cup 【59 mL】 of
   heavy cream. Bring to simmer again for two minutes or so, blending in drops of more cream if the spinach seems too
   thick.
6. Season carefully with salt and pepper (a little goes a long way) Blend in a bit more butter if you’d like.
