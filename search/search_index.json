Stir    with a fork until the sugar dissolves and the syrup begins to bubble, about 7 minutes. Fill a ramekin with water,    then use it to wet a pastry brush and wipe all around the edges of the pot, wherever you see sugar crystals or    splashes of syrup. Re-wet the brush as needed, \u201cwashing\u201d around the sides until totally clean. Be generous! Extra    water will not hurt the pie filling, but sugar crystals will.</li> <li>Crank the heat to medium-high and clip on a digital thermometer. Cook without stirring until the syrup is honey    colored and 325\u00b0, about 12 minutes. Immediately remove from the heat, add the butter all at once, and stir with a    heat-resistant spatula until the foam subsides. Cool the syrup to 200\u00b0, about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally to    ensure it cools at an even rate. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 350\u00b0.</li> <li>Whisk the eggs and vanilla (or booze) in a medium bowl until well combined, then fold in the pecans with a flexible    spatula. Pour the hot butterscotch over the eggy-pecans and fold with a spatula until the pecans are well coated in    butterscotch and the eggs are mostly absorbed.

When fully baked, the pie will register 210\u00b0 in the center. Cool at least 2 hours before    slicing with a chef's knife; prior to that the filling will be warm and runny.</li> <li>Wrapped in plastic, leftovers will keep 3 days at room temperature, or a week in the fridge.</li> </ul> <p>Troubleshooting:</p> <ul> <li>This recipe depends on an accurate digital thermometer, and when things go wrong you can bet the readings were off.   This can happen by misreading an analogue thermometer, failing to fully submerge the probe in the syrup, or simply   when good thermometers go bad (a sad fact of life). It can also happen with meat thermometers not intended for high   heat, or when the batteries start to fade. Check the temperature range of your thermometer to be certain it can   register 335\u00b0, then test its accuracy by making sure it reads 212\u00b0 in a pot of boiling water.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"curated-untested/pecan-pie/#recommended-pie-crust-recipe","title":"Recommended Pie Crust Recipe","text":"<p>Ingredients</p> <ul> <li>8 ounces\u3010227 g\u3011 low-protein all-purpose flour, such as Gold Medal Blue Label (1 2/3 cups\u3010394 mL\u3011; 225g), plus more for   dusting</li> <li>1/2 ounce\u301014 g\u3011 sugar (1 tablespoon; 15g)</li> <li>1 teaspoon (4g) Diamond Crystal kosher salt; for table salt, use half as much by volume or use the same weight</li> <li>8 ounces\u3010227 g\u3011 unsalted, American-style butter, straight from the fridge (2 sticks; 225g), cold</li> <li>4 ounces\u3010113 g\u3011 cold tap water (1/2 cup\u3010118 mL\u3011; 115g)</li> </ul> <p>Directions</p> <ul> <li>For the Dough:<ol> <li>Whisk flour, sugar, and salt together in a medium bowl.</li> <li>Cut butter into cubes no smaller than 1/2 inch\u30101.27 cm\u3011, and toss with flour mixture to break up the pieces.</li> <li>With your fingertips, smash each cube flat\u2014that's it!

At the very top of the list of the most popular menu items at the stores' cafeteria-style IKEA Restaurant &amp; Bistro are the Swedish Meatballs, which are consumed at a rate of 150 million each year. The meatballs are moist and delicious and come smothered in a cream sauce and served with a side of lingonberry jam. But if you don't feel like working your way through the giant rat maze of furniture that is the ingenious layout of each store to get to a plate of these meatballs, you can now make them at home with very little effort. The secret is to use ground beef that is 20 percent fat and a food processor to puree all of the ingredients. If you don't have a food processor, a blender will work to puree the onions, which you can add to the rest of the ingredients and mix thoroughly with your hands. I found that a 1 \u00bc-inch cookie scooper is the best way to form the balls, but you can also form the balls with a teaspoon measure and your hands-keep your hands thoroughly moistened with water to prevent the meat mixture from sticking to them.</p> <p>MEATBALLS 1/3 cup chopped onion 1 large egg 1 egg white 1/3 cup beef broth 2 tablespoons water \u00bd pound ground beef (20 percent fat) \u00bd pound ground pork \u00bd cup plain bread crumbs 1 teaspoon salt \u00bd teaspoon white pepper 1/8 teaspoon allspice</p> <p>CREAM SAUCE 1 \u00bc cups beef broth 1/3 cup heavy cream 4 teaspoons cornstarch 1 tablespoon apple juice \u00bc teaspoon salt 1/8 teaspoon garlic powder 1/8 teaspoon onion powder 1/8 teaspoon white pepper 1 bay leaf 2 teaspoons vegetable oil</p> <p>ON THE SIDE (OPTIONAL) Lingonberry preserves</p> <p>Directions</p> <ol> <li>Combine the onion, egg, egg white, beef broth, and water in a food processor or blender and mix on high speed for 15    seconds or until the onion is completely pulverized.    If using a blender, pour this mixture into a large bowl and combine it with the ground meats, bread crumbs, and    seasoning.    Mix thoroughly with your hands.    If using a food processor, add the ground meats, bread crumbs, and seasoning to the food processor and mix on high    speed for 30 seconds or until all of the ingredients are combined and the meat has a smooth consistency.</li> <li>Preheat your oven to 350 degrees F.</li> <li>Use a 1/3-ounce cookie scooper (or a teaspoon measure) moistened with water to form balls that are about 1 \u00bc inches    in diameter.    Moisten your fingers with water to make forming the balls easier.    Place the balls on a nonstick baking sheet or a baking sheet lined with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat and    bake for 20 to 25 minutes or until the meatballs are just lightly browned.    Turn the meatballs over halfway through the cooking time.</li> <li>While the meatballs are baking, make the sauce by whisking all of the ingredients, except the bay leaf, into a small    saucepan over medium heat.    When the mixture begins to bubble, add the bay leaf, then reduce the heat and simmer for 6 to 7 minutes or until    thick.    Discard the bay leaf.</li> <li>Just before you are ready to serve the meatballs, brown them in a saute pan over medium heat with a couple of    teaspoons of vegetable oil.    Serve the meatballs with the cream sauce poured over the top along with a small side of lingonberry preserves, if    desired.</li> <li>TIDBITS: You can freeze the meatballs after they have baked.    To reheat, add 2 teaspoons of oil to a saute pan over medium heat.    Cook the meatballs in the pan, stirring often, until browned and hot all the way through.</li> </ol>"},{"location":"curated-untested/ikea-meatballs/swedish-meatballs/","title":"Swedish Meatballs","text":"<ul> <li>From krumkake</li> <li>40 minutes to make</li> <li>Serves 6</li> </ul> <p>This was usually served during the holidays in the Scandinavian family I grew up in.

I used one package of classic cherry tomatoes and one package of cherry tomatoes on   the vine.</li> <li>feta \u2013 you'll want to get a nice higher quality Greek feta since it's the main flavor of the dish. Grab a block of   feta, the kind that comes in a brine, not the crumbles. If you want a milder, creamier feta, try French feta, it's   less tart than Greek.</li> <li>olive oil \u2013 most of the recipes I've seen call from anywhere from 1/4 to 1/2 cup of olive oil. I went with 1/3 cup,   you want enough to coat the tomatoes and feta while having a bit of oil pool at the bottom of your baking dish so the   tomatoes are essentially doing a tomato confit type thing.

Fill slow cooker with 4-5 lbs sliced onions, pour 1/3 cup olive over the onions &amp; mix well. Cover with lid and cook on HIGH for 7-9 hours. Yes it does indeed needs to be High. I had my doubts at first, but I've done this probably at least 20 times and the onions cook way down &amp; caramelize beautifully. I haven't tried this yet with my new multi-cooker but plan to try that next using slow cooker function.</p> <p>Elisa (3 years ago) Great and easy recipe. I suggest doubling the onions and mixing in some leeks. Also, since I don't have oven proof casseroles, I toasted the bread with the cheese on top (in toaster oven), and served on regular soup bowls.</p> <p>Gonzalo (2 years ago) 1 Tbsp of Sherry is a very small amount, it won't add any significant flavour. Also, if Sherry boils for a long time, it completely loses its aroma.

I also tend to use more vinegar in the brine because it mimics the taste of buttermilk, something I rarely have on hand when a fried chicken craving hits.</p> <p>\"One of the secret methods that Famous Recipe is barred from using is (the) use of two different heat outputs from the burners during the actual process of cooking chicken in pressure cookers. Specifically, this means that Famous cannot reduce the flame output while cooking the chicken.\" 1968 was still in the era of regular stove-top 16 quart Pressure Cookers (Automatic cookers didn't become available until 1972). This quote indicates - as does Colonel Sanders' 1962 Patent - that a part of the official cooking process is that once the pressure cooker lid is sealed and full pressure is achieved, then the gas flame is to be reduced... (And this is so that the ideal cooking temperature of 250 degrees Fahrenheit (at 15 pounds per square inch) can be maintain for the duration of the cooking process.)</p> <p>Cut one 3\u00bd- 4lb fryer into 9 pieces and brine for 4 hours.</p> <p>Make sure you have corn oil on hand for frying.</p> <p>Brine:</p> <ul> <li>4 cups of water</li> <li>1 tbsp white Vinegar</li> <li>1 tbsp table salt, non iodized</li> <li>1 tbsp Sugar, white</li> <li>1 tbsp MSG</li> <li>Cut chicken into 9 pieces, rinse and place into well mixed brine and refrigerate. After 4 hours, remove the chicken   from brine and rinse in fresh water.</li> <li>Add the brined chicken to egg wash.</li> </ul> <p>Egg Wash:</p> <ul> <li>3/4 cup whole milk</li> <li>1 large egg</li> </ul> <p>Mix well in a pan large enough to hold the chicken. Place chicken into egg wash and mix to coat the pieces. Let sit for 10 minutes on the counter while you prepare your seasoned flour. You are going to need anywhere from 2 - 3 1/2 cups of seasoned flour depending on the size of your bird. It is best to start off with a smaller amount and add more as you need it. If you like crumbly chicken breading you can add a bit of milk, (between 1-3 teaspoons) to the flour and mix it up well. This will make shaggy, crumbly pieces. If you don't use cake flour for your breading this step can cause your breading to get tough and hard from gluten formation.</p> <p>If you don't use low protein flour like cake flour or White Lily then the chicken coating will become very gluey, dense and hard. You also will need low protein flour for the biscuits too. If you can find unbleached pastry flour it is ideal. The bleaching process allows manufacturers to include substandard parts of the wheat that can cause the breading to be tough.)</p> <p>The salt is added after the chicken has been cooked, for each 4lb chicken use about 4ts popcorn salt. Some people find that too salty so you might want to reduce it some. I use finely ground sea salt.</p> <p>You need about 2 to 2 1/2 cups of this breading for a 3 1/2 to 4 lb bird plus extra for the milk gravy.</p> <p>If you have a pressure fryer that is the Colonel's method to fry chicken. If you don't, deep fat frying is also good but the chicken will be less moist but the crust will be crispy.</p> <p>Pan Fry/Oven Method</p> <p>Preheat your oven to 400 degrees.</p> <p>Dip chicken in seasoned flour and shake off the excess. If you want crunchier chicken mix a little milk with the breading, about an ounce or so, enough to make the flour shaggy. (If you don't use low protein flour this step will cause your chicken to be gluey and hard.) Press the flour firmly on the egg/milk dipped chicken.</p> <p>Heat corn or vegetable oil in 11-inch straight-sided saut\u00e9 pan over medium-high heat to 355 degrees. Carefully place chicken pieces in pan, skin side down, and cook until golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Carefully flip and continue to cook chicken until instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest part of chicken registers 160 degrees for breasts and 175 for legs and thighs, 15 to 20 minutes. (Smaller pieces may cook faster than larger pieces. Transfer chicken to wire rack set in rimmed baking sheet. Sprinkle with salt and keep warm while you fry the next batch.</p> <p>Alternative Method - Heat corn or vegetable oil in 11-inch straight-sided saut\u00e9 pan over medium-high heat to 375 degrees. Carefully place chicken pieces in pan, skin side down, and cook until golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Carefully flip and continue to cook until golden brown on second side, 2 to 4 minutes longer. Transfer chicken to wire rack set in rimmed baking sheet. Sprinkle with salt, bake chicken until instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest part of chicken registers 160 degrees for breasts and 175 for legs and thighs, 15 to 20 minutes. (Smaller pieces may cook faster than larger pieces. Remove pieces from oven as they reach -correct temperature.) Let chicken rest 5 minutes before serving.</p> <p>Alternative Method Some people think it is better to add the chicken to the hot oil, brown for one minute then put the lid on the pan, reduce heat to and continue cooking for 8 minutes, flip and cook 3-5 minutes longer or until the proper temperature is reached. If you have a lid, this method will produce a moisture chicken, but be careful. With the lid on condensation will form on the lid, be careful not to splash it all at once into the hot fat. You could start a grease fire if you aren't careful.</p> <p>Sometimes when I experiment with this method I will add a bit of baking powder to the flour mixture. Since the temperature is reduced it can inhibit browning, the baking powder will help counter balance that problem. Do not use too much or your chicken will be over browned. For 2 cups of seasoned flour add 1/8 to 1/4 tsp of baking powder.</p> <p>Milk Gravy with Cracklins</p> <ul> <li>1 TBSP butter (not margarine!!)</li> <li>1/4 cup seasoned breading flour (if you have any left over from breading your chicken use that)</li> <li>1/2 cup fried chicken cracklings strained from the pressure cooker or frying pan</li> <li>1 cup whole milk - cold</li> <li>1 cup boiling water</li> <li>1/4 cup whole cream - cold</li> </ul> <p>Put the butter, flour and cracklings into a frying pan over low to medium heat. Stir continuously until the ingredients are fully blended and the raw flour is lightly browned. This takes a few minutes. The roux should not be darker than peanut butter brown. If you burn it, dump it, clean the pan start again. (If you are a novice gravy maker you might want to save your cracklins until the end so you won't waste them on a burned batch.)</p> <p>Gently pour the milk, hot water, and cream, continue stirring until it begins to thicken. Taste the gravy and add extra salt or pepper if needed. Allow the mixture to come to a light boil, when it is the thickness you want turn off the heat and serve.</p> <p>COLONEL SANDERS' \"KENTUCKY\u201d BISCUITS</p> <ul> <li>1 \u00bd Cup flour (before sifting)</li> <li>1 \u00bd Tsp Salt</li> <li>1 Tbs Sugar</li> <li>1 Tbs Baking Powder</li> <li>Sift into mixing bowl</li> <li>1 Scant Cup Milk \u2013 sweet</li> </ul> <p>Shortening size of large egg.

Because eggs curdle once the temperature exceeds   65\u00b0C/150\u00b0F, most recipes instruct that the pasta be taken off the flame before adding beaten eggs. When making   carbonara, beaten egg yolks are to be tempered, which means you need to raise the temperature of the yolks   gradually, and essentially cook them without scrambling them. Tempered eggs are used in various sauces as a   binding agent or thickener, and even though they might look raw, they are actually perfectly cooked.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Method<ul> <li>A more traditional approach is to combine drained pasta, eggs, and guanciale in a pot where pasta was cooked, then   stir the ingredients over low heat until pasta gets coated with a creamy sauce, which may need loosening with a   bit of cooking water. However, it seems that the traditional approach may yield unsatisfactory results, which is   why it's often recommended to mix the carbonara sauce over a double broiler or even mix it with the hot pasta in a   large bowl allowing the heat of the pasta to cook it.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Eggs<ul> <li>Although traditionally, carbonara is prepared with egg yolks only, many recipes use whole eggs or a combination of   eggs and yolks. The number of egg yolks/eggs used is also a matter of debate, as recipes vary from 2 eggs per six   servings to four yolks/eggs for four servings. Also, to get an extra rich sauce, some recipes call for adding one   egg for every 4 egg yolks.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Egg Yolks Or Eggs<ul> <li>Although today it's been widely established that carbonara is prepared with egg yolks, there are also claims that   making carbonara with whole eggs is also traditional.</li> </ul> </li> <li>How Much Guanciale<ul> <li>The amount of guanciale varies from recipe to recipe. Some call for merely 25g (0.9 oz) per serving, while others   call for anywhere from 50g (1.75 oz) to 100 (3.5 oz) per serving.</li> </ul> </li> <li>How To Cut The Guanciale<ul> <li>Guanciale can be cut either into strips or into dices. Cutting guanciale into strips makes for a crispier,   crunchier guanciale once browned, especially if it's cut very thin, while cutting guanciale into dices will   produce guanciale that is crisp on the outside but soft on the inside, meaning the upon biting into one, the fat   on the inside would explode in one's mouth.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Browning Guanciale<ul> <li>Guanciale is to be saut\u00e9ed over low heat, and no fats or oils should be added to the pan beforehand. The excess   rendered fat can be removed, if desired, by soaking it up with a paper towel or by draining the guanciale and   discarding the fat. If the fat and the guanciale burns, it should not be used but thrown away, and a new batch   should be fried.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Guanciale Substitutes<ul> <li>If not available, guanciale or cured pork jowl can be substituted with Italian pancetta (unsmoked) or even bacon,   preferably of higher quality. However, while browning guanciale doesn't really require using extra fat, pancetta   and bacon are often browned in lard or olive oil, while some recipes opt for butter. In any case, guanciale, or   its substitutes, should be fried over medium heat, until lightly browned and rendered.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Cheese<ul> <li>Traditionally, the best cheese is Italian pecorino (sheep cheese), preferably the Pecorino Romano variety, but it   can be partially or entirely substituted with Parmigiano-Reggiano. However, this will make for a much saltier   carbonara sauce, especially if combined with pancetta or bacon, so take note and cut back on the salt when cooking   pasta. Also, because Pecorino Romano cheese is a hard-melting cheese, it's crucial that it's grated finely in   order to advance its melting properties.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Pasta<ul> <li>Spaghetti may be the standard choice of pasta, but other types of pasta like fettuccine, rigatoni, bucatini,   macherroni, and penne also work well with the carbonara sauce.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Cooking The Pasta<ul> <li>Even though Italians say that the water for cooking pasta should be salty as the Mediterranean when preparing   spaghetti alla carbonara, this rule should not be followed to a tee, as both guanciale and Pecorino Romano cheese   provide sufficient saltiness. Also, since starchy water in which the pasta was cooked adds to the creaminess of   the sauce, halving the amount of water typically used to boil pasta will produce an ultra-starchy leftover liquid,   which is one of the secrets to a velvety-smooth carbonara sauce. Because pasta will continue to cook with the   sauce, it should not be completely cooked but be taken out of the water just shy of al dente. Also, when done, it   should not be well-drained but instead should be taken out of the water with pliers, as residual starch liquid   improves the creaminess of the sauce.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Cream<ul> <li>Using cream is strictly forbidden and known as the biggest mistake in making spaghetti alla carbonara. The cream   is heavy and cloying, especially when reduced, and adding it to carbonara turns this delicate pasta sauce into a   thick sludge. However, some chefs like to add it because it expands the amount of time the carbonara sauce stays   creamy \u2014 carbonara, when made traditionally, turns dry quickly and needs to be served right away, before that   happens.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Additional Ingredients<ul> <li>In modern iterations of the recipe, garlic is often used, but only to infuse the oil; it is disposed of afterward.   According to some chefs, a splash of white wine is a welcomed addition, as are onions, while some like to add a   pop of color in the form of roughly chopped parsley.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Serving<ul> <li>While preparing spaghetti alla carbonara, it is recommended to warm the serving bowls/plates, as this will keep   the carbonara sauce creamy for longer. Also, carbonara should be served right after it's been prepared, as the   sauce turns dry very quickly.</li> </ul> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"recipes/pasta/pomodoro/","title":"Tomato sauce pasta","text":"<p>Based off a pomodoro / marinara sauce See also this reddit pomodoro recipe</p> <ol> <li>Slice a lot of tomatoes, maybe 500g-750g into a fry-able size</li> <li>Also slice (or press) half a head of garlic</li> <li>Fry in some olive oil until lightly browned on the skin side</li> <li>Add a little bit of salt and pepper, and squish the tomatoes</li> <li>Optionally add a little bit of:<ol> <li>beef / chicken stock</li> <li>tomato paste</li> <li>anchovy paste</li> <li>chili flakes</li> <li>oregano (suggested by github copilot)</li> <li>finely diced shallot</li> </ol> </li> <li>When almost ready, add torn fresh basil leaves<ol> <li>Must be fresh</li> <li>Torn to avoid bruising and browning</li> </ol> </li> <li>Add the pasta (and some pasta water) and stir to coat<ol> <li>Avoid adding salt in case this is too salty</li> </ol> </li> <li>salt and pepper to taste</li> <li>white wine?</li> </ol>"},{"location":"recipes/pasta/ragu-alla-bolognese/","title":"ragu alla bolognese","text":"<p>https://www.seriouseats.com/the-best-slow-cooked-bolognese-sauce-recipe https://www.insidehook.com/article/food-and-drink/chef-marc-forgione-rules-traditional-bolognese https://www.pastagrammar.com/post/rag%C3%B9-alla-bolognese-authentic-bolognese-sauce-recipe about 50-65g dried pasta per person (500g packet of dried pasta usually feeds 8-10) and pepper is important too</p>"},{"location":"recipes/pasta/ragu-alla-bolognese/#ingredients-part-1","title":"ingredients, part 1","text":"<ul> <li>1-2 carrots</li> <li>1 onion</li> <li>1-2 stalks celery</li> <li>1 red capsicum, cored</li> <li>1kg cherry tomatoes</li> <li>5 cloves garlic, peeled</li> <li>1 cup chicken or beef stock</li> <li>optional (fresh?) herbs</li> <li>salt and pepper</li> </ul>"},{"location":"recipes/pasta/ragu-alla-bolognese/#ingredients-part-2","title":"ingredients, part 2","text":"<ul> <li>100g-200g bacon, sliced very thinly and cut into small bits</li> <li>to make this halal, substitute with 50g beef fat plus a bit of salt</li> <li>250g ground mutton</li> <li>250g ground beef</li> <li>100-200g chicken livers, blended into a liquid paste</li> <li>herbs &amp;
