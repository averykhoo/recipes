## Schema

* how to display comments (e.g. chocolate chip cookies)
* how to format weights alongside measures
* basic conversions chart (1 cup = 16 Tbsp = 48 tsp = 240ml)
* common ingredient density chart (fine / granulated sugar: 1 cup = 200g)
* how to break a recipe down into sections / submodules
* standardized recipe format?
    * good way to specify of ingredient weights and measures - table?
    * needs to accommodate fuzzy measures - e.g. 1-2 Tbsp, a handful of something, knob of butter, ...
    * should the title be titlecase? how about the ingredients and instructions?
    * how many portions output
* should be possible to generate a shopping list from recipes and optional scaling
* highlight or link to relevant recipes or techniques
* comments / footnotes for notes and tips

## other todo

* pwa / serviceworker
* JSON-LD injection - inject via `json-ld` key into yaml frontmatter and use an _include template
* recipe parsing - requires some schema first
* dark mode toggle
* better link cleaning via markdown-soup, which will probably a concrete syntax tree wrapper around markdown-it-py
* consider not using the github jekyll action since it's very outdated
* change logo to cookie book / üç™üìñ / :cookie: :book: (does :cookie::book: work)
