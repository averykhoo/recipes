## Schema

* how to display comments (e.g. chocolate chip cookies)
* how to format weights alongside measures
* basic conversions chart (1 cup = 16 tbsp = 48 tsp = 240ml)
* common ingredient density chart (fine / granulated sugar: 1 cup = 200g)
* how to break a recipe down into sections / submodules
* standardized recipe format?
    * good way to specify of ingredient weights and measures - table?
    * needs to accommodate fuzzy measures - e.g. 1-2 tbsp, a handful of something, knob of butter, ...
    * should the title be titlecase? how about the ingredients and instructions?
    * how many portions output
* should be possible to generate a shopping list from recipes and optional scaling
* highlight or link to relevant recipes or techniques
