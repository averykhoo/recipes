# Build Repository Prompt Script (Using File Extensions & Regex Token Estimation) # MODIFIED

# regex, and constructs a detailed system prompt for an LLM. The prompt includes
# the repository structure and the content of included files, using consistent

**Synthesize this information to build a comprehensive internal understanding of the repository's:**
*   **Overall purpose:** What is this repository *for*? (e.g., a software project, documentation, recipe collection, project plan, notes)
*   **Structure and Organization:** How are the files and directories laid out? How do they logically group together?
*   **Key Components and Content:** What are the most important files, concepts, topics, data points, or pieces of information contained within?

Your goal is to develop a robust mental model of this repository based *only* on the provided snapshot. This understanding is crucial for you to accurately and effectively answer subsequent user questions about any aspect of the repository.
