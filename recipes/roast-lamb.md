# Roasted / Grilled Rack of Lamb

https://www.themediterraneandish.com/roast-lamb-rack-recipe/

* 3 tbsp dry rosemary
* 1 tbsp oregano
* 1 tbsp thyme
* 1 tsp paprika
* 1 tsp salt (can try up to 1 tbsp, it wasn't salty enough)
* 1 tsp pepper
* 20-30 cloves raw garlic
* about 1/2 cup olive oil
* 1 rack of lamb

1. Blend the spices and 3/4 of the olive oil in the smallest blender vessel possible to minimize the mess. Slowly add
   just enough olive oil until it forms a gluey paste. A full-size blender may be too small to make this portion size.
2. Prepare a rack of lamb, with 8-9 ribs, by:
    * optionally frenching it
    * cutting between the bones from the meat side, leaving them attached via the fat cap layer
    * scoring the fat cap diagonally and not too deeply
    * optionally wrapping foil around the bits of bone sticking out to prevent it from looking blackened after cooking
3. Slather all over the rack, as well as into the cuts and scores, and store in the fridge in a ziploc bag for a few
   hours or days. The pastiness of the garlic should help it stick on fairly well.
4. Preheat the oven to 120C and roast for 25-30 minutes
5. Poke around inside the cut between the bones to see how red it looks
6. Increase the temperature to 160-180C and finish for 5-10 minutes
7. To serve, just slice the fat cap in the appropriate locations. Also have mint sauce and/or jelly, and maybe some
   red wine shallot (or Bordelaise) sauce.
