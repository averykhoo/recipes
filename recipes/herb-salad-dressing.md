# Aglio Olio inspired Salad Dressing

Ingredients

* 1.5 cups olive oil - butter doesn't keep well
* 2 tsp salt
* 2 tsp ground black pepper
* 2 tsp dried rosemary
* 2 tsp dried oregano
* 3 tsp paprika powder
* 4 tsp dried basil
* 4 tsp dried parsley
* 20 cloves garlic, peeled

Directions

1. Blend everything
2. Fry till garlic is brown
3. Store in glass bottle

Notes

* Total about 5-6 tbsp herbs is the right proportion
* Garlic increased from 12 to 20, since Italians' garlic tolerance is weak
* Parmesan separate to make this more shelf-stable
* 3 tsp salt is too much salt
