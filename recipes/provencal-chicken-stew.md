Basically regular stew with olives and different herbs

* 4 boneless chicken thighs
* 1 tbsp herbs de provence:
    * traditionally rosemary, savory/thyme, oregano/marjoram
    * maybe basil/parsley, tarragon, bay leaf, fennel seed, optional lavender
* 1 cup chicken stock
    * optional 0.5 cup red wine to deglaze
* 400g halved cherry tomatoes
* 1 tsp anchovy paste
* mirepoix
    * 1 onion / 4-6 shallots, cubed
    * 1 big carrot, cubed
    * celery
* 8-10 cloves garlic, peeled but whole (much less if you're aiming for authenticity)
* optional 300g artichoke hearts
* 250g mushrooms (oyster is fine, but not golden needle mushrooms)
* 1 cup pitted whole olives
* finished with a bit of butter
* a few slices of bread

Not provencal:

* excess flour from fried chicken is fried and added into the stew to thicken
* peas, zucchini
* gelatin
* fish sauce replaces anchovy paste
* mustard
* capsicum in mirepoix
* apple for sweetness, large cubes
* potatoes, small cubes
