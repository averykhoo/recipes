* 500g floury potatoes, peeled and quartered
* 1/4 cup milk
* Butter
* 400g mixed selection of fish, e.g. smoked haddock, cod, salmon fillets ~~and prawns~~
* 1 cup milk
* White wine
* 1 medium onion, diced
* 1 leek, thinly sliced
* 1 Tbsp flour
* Parsley / dill
* Optional peas, boiled
* Salt and pepper
* Optional panko or crumbled ritz on top for texture

1. Preheat oven to 180-200°C.
2. Boil potatoes and mash with milk and butter until smooth. Optional yolk. Season with pepper.
3. Poach / simmer the fish in the milk and wine for about 5 minutes, longer if frozen. Aim to under-cook the fish.
4. Remove the fish and reserve the milk.
5. Saute onion and leek in the butter until translucent. Add flour and fry until not raw.
6. Use poaching milk to deglaze and make something like bechamel, but thicker and with onion chunks, like pie filling.
7. Add herbs, pepper, and optional boiled peas.
8. Layer fish, then bechamel, then potatoes in a casserole dish.
9. Use a fork to texture the top to get more crispy potato topping. Optional peas on top for decoration.
10. Bake for 15–20 minutes until the potato is golden brown.
11. Allow to cool and solidify before serving.
