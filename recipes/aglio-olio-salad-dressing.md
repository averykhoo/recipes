#   Aglio Salad Dressing

Ingredients
*   1.5 cups olive oil
*   2 tsp salt
*   2 tsp ground black pepper
*   2 tsp dried rosemary
*   2 tsp dried oregano
*   3 tsp paprika powder
*   4 tsp dried basil
*   4 tsp dried parsley
*   20 cloves garlic, peeled
	
Directions
1.  Blend everything
2.  Fry till garlic is brown
3.  Store in glass bottle

Notes
*   total about 5-6 tbsp herbs is the right proportion
*   garlic increased from 12 to 20, since Italians' garlic tolerance is weak
*   parmesan separate to make this more shelf-stable
*   3 tsp salt is too much salt
