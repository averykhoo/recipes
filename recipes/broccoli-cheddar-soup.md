3. Add garlic and flour, cook until fragrant
4. Add broth, broccoli, carrots, optional bouillon, and simmer until veggies are tender
5. Add most of the reserved bacon, cream, cheese, nutmeg, and simmer until cheese is just melted
   (do not boil, or the cheese will separate)

* Used leftover Christmas ham instead of bacon; skipped frying and added a bit more butter
* Skipped cayenne
* Also forgot to add nutmeg and mustard, but it was still good
