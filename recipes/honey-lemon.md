## honey lemon

* 2 large lemons
* about 800ml water
* 250g honey

1. zest the lemons into a saucepan
2. add half the water and boil to extract the flavor
3. pour through a fine mesh strainer into a jug
4. while the strainer is there, also squeeze in the lemons
5. return to pan, boil to extract the last bit of lemon flavor, and strain once more
6. add honey to taste, about 250-350g (depending on the size and acidity of the lemon)
7. leave to cool, then keep in the fridge
8. serve cold, with ice, optionally diluted with more water

notes:

* to make it less sour without adding more honey, only use the juice of one lemon
* orange zest or juice does not help
