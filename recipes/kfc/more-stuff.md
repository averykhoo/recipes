# More KFC recipes from reddit

I will give you what I have, the first quote is a debate from the forum about how the Colonel pressure cooked his
chicken. If you aren't interested in pressure cooking then just ignore it. The corn oil recommendation is good though.

Personally, I make up a large batch of seasoned flour and keep it in an air tight Cambro container. I rarely use a whole
chicken, instead I like to cook up about 12 legs, about 4lbs【1.81 kg】, because it's easier to keep track of cooking
times. For me frying 5 legs at a time takes about 15-17 minutes depending on their size. I also tend to use more vinegar
in the brine because it mimics the taste of buttermilk, something I rarely have on hand when a fried chicken craving
hits.

Cut one 3½- 4lb fryer into 9 pieces and brine for 4 hours.

Make sure you have corn oil on hand for frying.

## Ingredients for Brine:

* 4 cups of water
* 1 Tbsp white Vinegar
* 1 Tbsp table salt, non iodized
* 1 Tbsp Sugar, white
* 1 Tbsp MSG
* Cut chicken into 9 pieces, rinse and place into well mixed brine and refrigerate. After 4 hours, remove the chicken
  from brine and rinse in fresh water.
* Add the brined chicken to egg wash.

## Ingredients for Egg Wash:

* 3/4 cup whole milk
* 1 large egg

## Directions for deep frying

1. Mix well in a pan large enough to hold the chicken. Place chicken into egg wash and mix to coat the pieces. Let sit
   for
   10 minutes on the counter while you prepare your seasoned flour. You are going to need anywhere from 2 - 3 1/2 cups
   of
   seasoned flour depending on the size of your bird. It is best to start off with a smaller amount and add more as you
   need it. If you like crumbly chicken breading you can add a bit of milk, (between 1-3 teaspoons) to the flour and mix
   it up well. This will make shaggy, crumbly pieces. If you don't use cake flour for your breading this step can cause
   your breading to get tough and hard from gluten formation.

2. If you don't use low protein flour like cake flour or White Lily then the chicken coating will become very gluey,
   dense and hard. You also will need low protein flour for the biscuits too. If you can find unbleached pastry flour it
   is ideal. The bleaching process allows manufacturers to include substandard parts of the wheat that can cause the
   breading to be tough.)

3. The salt is added after the chicken has been cooked, for each 4lb chicken use about 4ts popcorn salt. Some people
   find that too salty so you might want to reduce it some. I use finely ground sea salt.

4. You need about 2 to 2 1/2 cups of this breading for a 3 1/2 to 4 lb bird plus extra for the milk gravy.

5. If you have a pressure fryer that is the Colonel's method to fry chicken. If you don't, deep fat frying is also good
   but the chicken will be less moist but the crust will be crispy.

## Directions for Pan Fry/Oven Method:

1. Preheat your oven to 400 degrees.

2. Dip chicken in seasoned flour and shake off the excess. If you want crunchier chicken mix a little milk with the
   breading, about an ounce or so, enough to make the flour shaggy. (If you don't use low protein flour this step will
   cause your chicken to be gluey and hard.) Press the flour firmly on the egg/milk dipped chicken.

3. Heat corn or vegetable oil in 11-inch straight-sided sauté pan over medium-high heat to 355 degrees. Carefully place
   chicken pieces in pan, skin side down, and cook until golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Carefully flip and continue to
   cook
   chicken until instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest part of chicken registers 160 degrees for breasts and
   175
   for legs and thighs, 15 to 20 minutes. (Smaller pieces may cook faster than larger pieces. Transfer chicken to wire
   rack
   set in rimmed baking sheet. Sprinkle with salt and keep warm while you fry the next batch.

## Directions for Alternative Method

1. Heat corn or vegetable oil in 11-inch straight-sided sauté pan over medium-high heat to 375
   degrees. Carefully place chicken pieces in pan, skin side down, and cook until golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes.
   Carefully
   flip and continue to cook until golden brown on second side, 2 to 4 minutes longer. Transfer chicken to wire rack set
   in
   rimmed baking sheet. Sprinkle with salt, bake chicken until instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest part of
   chicken registers 160 degrees for breasts and 175 for legs and thighs, 15 to 20 minutes. (Smaller pieces may cook
   faster
   than larger pieces. Remove pieces from oven as they reach -correct temperature.) Let chicken rest 5 minutes before
   serving.

## Notes

1. Some people think it is better to add the chicken to the hot oil, brown for one minute then put the
   lid on the pan, reduce heat to and continue cooking for 8 minutes, flip and cook 3-5 minutes longer or until the
   proper
   temperature is reached. If you have a lid, this method will produce a moisture chicken, but be careful. With the lid
   on
   condensation will form on the lid, be careful not to splash it all at once into the hot fat. You could start a grease
   fire if you aren't careful.

2. Sometimes when I experiment with this method I will add a bit of baking powder to the flour mixture. Since the
   temperature is reduced it can inhibit browning, the baking powder will help counter balance that problem. Do not use
   too
   much or your chicken will be over browned. For 2 cups of seasoned flour add 1/8 to 1/4 tsp of baking powder.

# Milk Gravy with Cracklins

## Ingredients

* 1 TBSP butter (not margarine!!)
* 1/4 cup seasoned breading flour (if you have any left over from breading your chicken use that)
* 1/2 cup fried chicken cracklings strained from the pressure cooker or frying pan
* 1 cup whole milk - cold
* 1 cup boiling water
* 1/4 cup whole cream - cold

## Directions

1. Put the butter, flour and cracklings into a frying pan over low to medium heat. Stir continuously until the
   ingredients are fully blended and the raw flour is lightly browned. This takes a few minutes. The roux should not be
   darker than peanut butter brown. If you burn it, dump it, clean the pan start again. (If you are a novice gravy maker
   you might want to save your cracklins until the end so you won't waste them on a burned batch.)
2. Gently pour the milk, hot water, and cream, continue stirring until it begins to thicken. Taste the gravy and add
   extra salt or pepper if needed. Allow the mixture to come to a light boil, when it is the thickness you want turn off
   the heat and serve.

# KFC Whipped Mashed Potatoes

Yields 4 to 6 servings

## Ingredients:

* 2 pounds Russet potatoes, about 8 medium
* 1/3 to 1/2 cup milk, half and half, heavy cream or whipping cream
* 1/4 cup butter (3 tablespoons)
* 1/8 teaspoon fresh ground black pepper
* 1 tsp of Kosher salt

## Directions:

1. Peel potatoes and quarter. Place in a medium saucepan; add water and a few teaspoons of salt.
   Bring to a boil; cover and cook for 15 to 20 minutes, until tender.* Drain well.
2. Beat potatoes in saucepan over low heat with electric hand-held mixer on low speed until broken up.
   Heat milk and butter together.
   Pour hot milk and butter over hot potatoes and beat on high speed until fluffy,
   scraping sides and bottom of pan occasionally.
3. Season with salt and pepper.

Tip: if it starts to boil over drop in a couple of ice cubes and turn the flame down a little. You can also prevent
boiling over by adding a tablespoon of oil.

*Also add the milk and butter a little at a time. If it's too runny you can't fix it unless you add in some instant
mashed potatoes (a little trick someone on IRON CHEF could have used when they made a disastrous attempt at whipped
potatoes that even baking didn't fix!)*
