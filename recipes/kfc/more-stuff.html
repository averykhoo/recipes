<p>I will give you what I have, the first quote is a debate from the forum about how the Colonel pressure cooked his
chicken. If you aren’t interested in pressure cooking then just ignore it. The corn oil recommendation is good though.</p>

<p>Personally, I make up a large batch of seasoned flour and keep it in an air tight Cambro container. I rarely use a whole
chicken, instead I like to cook up about 12 legs, about 4lbs【1.81 kg】, because it’s easier to keep track of cooking
times. For me frying 5 legs at a time takes about 15-17 minutes depending on their size. I also tend to use more vinegar
in the brine because it mimics the taste of buttermilk, something I rarely have on hand when a fried chicken craving
hits.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“One of the secret methods that Famous Recipe is barred from using is (the) use of two different heat outputs from the
burners during the actual process of cooking chicken in pressure cookers. Specifically, this means that Famous cannot
reduce the flame output while cooking the chicken.” 1968 was still in the era of regular stove-top 16 quart Pressure
Cookers (Automatic cookers didn’t become available until 1972). This quote indicates - as does Colonel Sanders’ 1962
Patent - that a part of the official cooking process is that once the pressure cooker lid is sealed and full pressure
is achieved, then the gas flame is to be reduced… (And this is so that the ideal cooking temperature of 250 degrees
Fahrenheit (at 15 pounds per square inch) can be maintain for the duration of the cooking process.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Cut one 3½- 4lb fryer into 9 pieces and brine for 4 hours.</p>

<p>Make sure you have corn oil on hand for frying.</p>

<p><strong>Brine:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>4 cups of water</li>
  <li>1 tbsp white Vinegar</li>
  <li>1 tbsp table salt, non iodized</li>
  <li>1 tbsp Sugar, white</li>
  <li>1 tbsp MSG</li>
  <li>Cut chicken into 9 pieces, rinse and place into well mixed brine and refrigerate. After 4 hours, remove the chicken
from brine and rinse in fresh water.</li>
  <li>Add the brined chicken to egg wash.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Egg Wash:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>3/4 cup whole milk</li>
  <li>1 large egg</li>
</ul>

<p>Mix well in a pan large enough to hold the chicken. Place chicken into egg wash and mix to coat the pieces. Let sit for
10 minutes on the counter while you prepare your seasoned flour. You are going to need anywhere from 2 - 3 1/2 cups of
seasoned flour depending on the size of your bird. It is best to start off with a smaller amount and add more as you
need it. If you like crumbly chicken breading you can add a bit of milk, (between 1-3 teaspoons) to the flour and mix it
up well. This will make shaggy, crumbly pieces. If you don’t use cake flour for your breading this step can cause your
breading to get tough and hard from gluten formation.</p>

<p>If you don’t use low protein flour like cake flour or White Lily then the chicken coating will become very gluey, dense
and hard. You also will need low protein flour for the biscuits too. If you can find unbleached pastry flour it is
ideal. The bleaching process allows manufacturers to include substandard parts of the wheat that can cause the breading
to be tough.)</p>

<p>The salt is added after the chicken has been cooked, for each 4lb chicken use about 4ts popcorn salt. Some people find
that too salty so you might want to reduce it some. I use finely ground sea salt.</p>

<p>You need about 2 to 2 1/2 cups of this breading for a 3 1/2 to 4 lb bird plus extra for the milk gravy.</p>

<p>If you have a pressure fryer that is the Colonel’s method to fry chicken. If you don’t, deep fat frying is also good but
the chicken will be less moist but the crust will be crispy.</p>

<p><strong>Pan Fry/Oven Method</strong></p>

<p>Preheat your oven to 400 degrees.</p>

<p>Dip chicken in seasoned flour and shake off the excess. If you want crunchier chicken mix a little milk with the
breading, about an ounce or so, enough to make the flour shaggy. (If you don’t use low protein flour this step will
cause your chicken to be gluey and hard.) Press the flour firmly on the egg/milk dipped chicken.</p>

<p>Heat corn or vegetable oil in 11-inch straight-sided sauté pan over medium-high heat to 355 degrees. Carefully place
chicken pieces in pan, skin side down, and cook until golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Carefully flip and continue to cook
chicken until instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest part of chicken registers 160 degrees for breasts and 175
for legs and thighs, 15 to 20 minutes. (Smaller pieces may cook faster than larger pieces. Transfer chicken to wire rack
set in rimmed baking sheet. Sprinkle with salt and keep warm while you fry the next batch.</p>

<p>Alternative Method - Heat corn or vegetable oil in 11-inch straight-sided sauté pan over medium-high heat to 375
degrees. Carefully place chicken pieces in pan, skin side down, and cook until golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Carefully
flip and continue to cook until golden brown on second side, 2 to 4 minutes longer. Transfer chicken to wire rack set in
rimmed baking sheet. Sprinkle with salt, bake chicken until instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest part of
chicken registers 160 degrees for breasts and 175 for legs and thighs, 15 to 20 minutes. (Smaller pieces may cook faster
than larger pieces. Remove pieces from oven as they reach -correct temperature.) Let chicken rest 5 minutes before
serving.</p>

<p>Alternative Method Some people think it is better to add the chicken to the hot oil, brown for one minute then put the
lid on the pan, reduce heat to and continue cooking for 8 minutes, flip and cook 3-5 minutes longer or until the proper
temperature is reached. If you have a lid, this method will produce a moisture chicken, but be careful. With the lid on
condensation will form on the lid, be careful not to splash it all at once into the hot fat. You could start a grease
fire if you aren’t careful.</p>

<p>Sometimes when I experiment with this method I will add a bit of baking powder to the flour mixture. Since the
temperature is reduced it can inhibit browning, the baking powder will help counter balance that problem. Do not use too
much or your chicken will be over browned. For 2 cups of seasoned flour add 1/8 to 1/4 tsp of baking powder.</p>

<p>Milk Gravy with Cracklins</p>

<ul>
  <li>1 TBSP butter (not margarine!!)</li>
  <li>1/4 cup seasoned breading flour (if you have any left over from breading your chicken use that)</li>
  <li>1/2 cup fried chicken cracklings strained from the pressure cooker or frying pan</li>
  <li>1 cup whole milk - cold</li>
  <li>1 cup boiling water</li>
  <li>1/4 cup whole cream - cold</li>
</ul>

<p>Put the butter, flour and cracklings into a frying pan over low to medium heat. Stir continuously until the ingredients
are fully blended and the raw flour is lightly browned. This takes a few minutes. The roux should not be darker than
peanut butter brown. If you burn it, dump it, clean the pan start again. (If you are a novice gravy maker you might want
to save your cracklins until the end so you won’t waste them on a burned batch.)</p>

<p>Gently pour the milk, hot water, and cream, continue stirring until it begins to thicken. Taste the gravy and add extra
salt or pepper if needed. Allow the mixture to come to a light boil, when it is the thickness you want turn off the heat
and serve.</p>

<p>COLONEL SANDERS’ “KENTUCKY” BISCUITS</p>

<ul>
  <li>1 ½ Cup flour (before sifting)</li>
  <li>1 ½ Tsp Salt</li>
  <li>1 Tbs Sugar</li>
  <li>1 Tbs Baking Powder</li>
  <li>Sift into mixing bowl</li>
  <li>1 Scant Cup Milk – sweet</li>
</ul>

<p>Shortening size of large egg. Nest the flour, add most of milk, put in shortening, begin squeezing the shortening and
flour in the milk until thoroughly mixed, add rest of milk if needed and mix. Turn on to floured board, knead until
consistency desired, cut into biscuits. Makes 13 biscuits.</p>

<p>(Use Standard Measuring Cup and Spoon – Level Measurements)</p>

<p>Coleslaw</p>

<ul>
  <li>½ cup Miracle Whip (he said other brands turned the mixture grey)</li>
  <li>½ cup tarragon vinegar (The Col used Heinz but it is hard to find these days)</li>
  <li>½ cup sugar</li>
  <li>¼ cup salad oil</li>
  <li>dash salt to taste</li>
  <li>1 head cabbage, cored and chopped not shredded</li>
  <li>1-2 carrots, shredded - optional</li>
  <li>1/4 cup shredded onion - optional</li>
</ul>

<p>Chop the cabbage, grate the carrots and onion. Add other ingredients, mix well, cover well, let flavors meld over night
in refrigerator. Some people say that carrots and onion were not in the original coleslaw recipe so feel free to leave
them out. Chopped the cabbage, don’t shred it.</p>

<p>KFC Whipped Mashed Potatoes</p>

<p>Ingredients:</p>

<ul>
  <li>2 pounds Russet potatoes, about 8 medium</li>
  <li>1/3 to 1/2 cup milk, half and half, heavy cream or whipping cream</li>
  <li>1/4 cup butter (3 tablespoons)</li>
  <li>1/8 teaspoon fresh ground black pepper</li>
  <li>1 tsp of Kosher salt</li>
</ul>

<p>Preparation:
Peel potatoes and quarter. Place in a medium saucepan; add water and a few teaspoons of salt. Bring to a boil; cover and
cook for 15 to 20 minutes, until tender.* Drain well.</p>

<p>Beat potatoes in saucepan over low heat with electric hand-held mixer on low speed until broken up. Heat milk and butter
together. Pour hot milk and butter over hot potatoes and beat on high speed until fluffy, scraping sides and bottom of
pan occasionally.** Season with salt and pepper. Serves 4 to 6.</p>

<p>Tip if it starts to boil over drop in a couple of ice cubes and turn the flame down a little. You can also prevent
boiling over by adding a tablespoon of oil.</p>

<p><em>Also add the milk and butter a little at a time. If it’s too runny you can’t fix it unless you add in some instant
mashed potatoes (a little trick someone on IRON CHEF could have used when they made a disastrous attempt at whipped
potatoes that even baking didn’t fix!)</em></p>

<p>COLONEL SANDERS’ BEAN SALAD</p>

<ul>
  <li>1 No. 2 Can Green Beans (Blue Lake or some good quality)</li>
  <li>1 No. 2 Can Wax Beans</li>
  <li>1 No. 2 Can Kidney Beans</li>
  <li>1 Medium size Green Pepper (sliced and cut up)</li>
  <li>1 Medium size White Onion (sliced and cut up)</li>
  <li>1/2 Cup Salad Oil</li>
  <li>1/2 Cup Cider Vinegar</li>
  <li>3/4 Cup Sugar</li>
  <li>1 1/2 Tsp. Salt</li>
  <li>1/2 Tsp. Black Pepper</li>
</ul>

<p>Drain all beans well, then rinse the kidney beans well. Now combine all ingredients - Let marinate overnight and they
are better after 3 or 4 days.</p>
