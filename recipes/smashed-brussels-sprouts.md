# Smashed Brussels Sprouts

The same method works for potatoes, sweet potatoes, and beetroot

* Brussels sprouts, with root end trimmed
* Herbs & spices options
    * Paprika
    * Garlic
    * Shallots / onion powder
    * Thyme
    * Sesame / poppy seeds
* Cheese options
    * Manchego
    * Parmesan
    * Mozzarella

1. Parboil brussels sprouts in salted water, then (optionally) cool in an ice bath to retain color. Pat dry.
2. Squash every brussels sprout flat. 
3. Coat with olive oil, herbs and spices, cheese, salt, and pepper.
4. Arrange in a single layer in a baking tray, and bake at 220°C for 15 mins. Flip and bake for another 5-10 mins.
   (Also okay to bake at 170°C for 15 mins for both sides.)
5. Optionally drizzle with lemon juice and garnish with parsley.
