# Lazy Brownies

one portion makes about 260ml of brownie.
scale up as necessary to fit your pan.
this is how big a pan you need for a 1-inch tall brownie:

| scale | square | round |
|-------|--------|-------|
| 1x    | 4"     | 4.5"  |
| 2x    | 5.5"   | 6"    |
| 3x    | 7"     | 8"    |
| 4x    | 8"     | 9"    |
| 5x    | 9"     | 10"   |
| 6x    | 9.5"   | 11"   |
| 7x    | 10.5"  | 12"   |
| 8x    | 11"    | 12.5" |

## ingredients

* 50g butter
* 50g chocolate chips
* 80g sugar
* 1/8 tsp (or one pinch) of salt
* 1/4 tsp vanilla extract
* 1 egg (55g)
* 50g cake / plain flour
* 40g optional mixins (e.g., more (unmelted) chocolate chips, nuts, etc.)
    * chop choc chips a little finer - too big is hard to eat when cold

## directions

1. microwave the butter and chocolate until just melted, and mix to form a smooth cream
2. preheat oven to 180°C, preset timer for 20 mins
3. mix in the sugar, salt, vanilla, and egg(s)
4. fold in the flour
5. fold in the mix-ins
6. bake at 180°C for 20 mins, in a pan lined with baking paper
7. leave on counter and let cool to room temp
8. solidify in fridge once cool (warm things will spoil fridge food)
9. remove from pan once hardened and cut into pieces
10. serve warmed (in a microwave for a few seconds) with ice cream

## optional

* small bit of instant coffee powder
* malt / horlicks powder
* add butter/cream = more gooey
* add flour = more cakey
* seen on tiktok - add a frozen layer of nutella and speculoos in the middle
