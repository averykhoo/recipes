# Meema's Sherry Trifle

* circa 1970

Ingredients

* 1 can fruit cocktail (with peaches, not pineapple)
* 3 tbsp sherry
* 1 walnut butter cake
* [Bird's Custard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird's_Custard) powder
* UHT milk
* 1.5 cups whipping cream (e.g. 38% fat whipping cream, from Phoon Huat)
* 1 tsp icing sugar

Method

1. 1 can fruit cocktail:
    * Separate fruit from syrup and reserve both separately
    * Pour syrup from can into a bowl and add 3 tbsp sherry to the syrup
    * Select & separate the red cherries from the fruit cocktail - reserve for decoration
2. Cut the walnut butter cake into 1 inch thick slices
3. Cook the Bird's Custard with UHT milk
    * Softer wobbly creamy custard for the bottom layers (add more milk)
    * Firmer custard for the final top layer
4. Choose a pretty crystal bowl in which to add the layers:
    1. Place a layer of walnut cake slices on the bottom of the bowl.
    2. Use a tablespoon / chinese soup spoon to pour the sherry syrup over each cake slice
    3. Spoon a layer of fruit cocktail over the cake, filling spaces between the cake
    4. Pour the softer custard over the fruit cocktail
    5. Repeat the layers above:
        * Cake + sherry syrup -> fruit -> (softer) custard
        * Use the firmer custard for the final topping
        * Until bowl is full within 1 cm from the top (leave space for the cream topping)
5. Put whipping cream in a clean bowl.
   Add 1 tsp icing sugar to the cream.
   Whip the cream with an electric mixer until soft peaks form, 3 to 5 minutes.
6. Cover the trifle with whipped cream.
    * Decorate with the red cherries

Optional:

* Add fresh blueberries in the fruit layers
