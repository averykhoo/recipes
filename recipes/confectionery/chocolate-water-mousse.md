Ingredients:

* 200g dark chocolate, finely chopped (high in cocoa butter)
* 150g water
* (optional) tiny pinch of fine salt

Method:

1. Place chopped-up chocolate in a big bowl, and prepare an ice bath (with a towel on the bottom to hold it in place).
2. Bring the water to a boil, then pour over the chocolate.
3. Allow to sit for a while to allow chocolate to warm up, then stir until all the chocolate has melted.
4. Place the bowl of chocolate over the ice bath.
5. Whip at high speed until the mixture thickens to the consistency of molasses (about 5 minutes).
6. Continue mixing / whipping at low speed until the chocolate thickens (caused by cooling)
7. Serve immediately at room temperature.
8. Otherwise, keep covered in the fridge (it will eventually solidify).
9. Reheat gently over a bain-marie (to soften it), and whisk before serving.

Notes:

* The chocolate will thicken all of a sudden, so do watch for this and remove from the ice bath as soon as you see this
  happening, lest it'll turn hard and clumpy if left to cool too much. Don't worry if this happens though, just heat the
  bowl over a water bath/bain-marie, stir, and the mousse will come together again!
* If the chocolate mixture doesn't contain enough fat, it won't whip into a foam.
  Melt the mixture again over a bain marie and add more chocolate.
* If the mousse isn't light enough, melt the mixture and add more water.
* If the mixture is over-whipped, it will become grainy. Melt the mixture and restart.

my notes:

* this works well with coffee in place of water, for a kind of mocha mousse
