Makes 12 biscuits.

Tips:

* Use fresh milk
* Use cold butter to create a flaky texture
* Sift the self-raising flour before adding it to the dough
* Use a fork or pastry cutter to evenly distribute the butter throughout the dough
* Refrigerate the dough for a few minutes before shaping it into balls to make it easier to handle
* Leave plenty of space between the dough balls on the baking tray to allow for expansion as they bake
* Keep an eye on the biscuits as they bake to ensure they don't burn

Ingredients:

* 225g (1.6 cups) [self-raising flour](self-raising-flour.md), sifted
    * 210g flour or cake flour
    * 2 tsp baking powder
    * 1 tsp salt
* 100g fine sugar
* 100g butter, cold and cut into cubes
* 1 medium egg
* 1 Tbsp fresh milk or cream
* 50g raspberry jam
* (to try out) 1 tsp vanilla, tiny pinch of cinnamon

Method:

1. Preheat your oven to 200째C (400째F) and line two baking trays with baking paper.
2. Sprinkle flour over the surface of the trays and spread it around by tipping the trays from side to side.
3. Sift the self-raising flour into a blender or mixing bowl.
4. Mix in the sugar.
5. Use a fork, pastry cutter, or blend to cut in the butter, until the mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs.
6. In a small bowl, whisk together the egg and milk.
7. Add the egg mixture to the flour mixture and stir by hand to form a stiff dough. If using a blender, blend in the
   butter first, then pulse in the egg until just combined.
8. Divide the dough into 12 portions and shape each one into a firm ball, each weighing about 40g, and about 3-4cm in
   diameter. (If you make 24x 20g cookies, baking time should decrease to 8 minutes.)
9. Transfer the balls to the prepared baking trays, leaving plenty of space between them.
10. Press each ball to 1.5 cm flat and use a melon scoop or teaspoon to make a depression in the center of each biscuit.
11. Place 1 tsp (or melon scoop) of jam into the depression of each biscuit.
12. Bake the biscuits at 200째C (400째F) for 10 minutes until they are risen and golden brown.
13. Allow the biscuits to cool before serving. Enjoy with fresh whipped cream.

Storage:

* Once the biscuits have cooled completely, you can store them in an airtight container at room temperature. This will
  keep them fresh and prevent them from drying out. If you live in a very humid area, you may want to store the biscuits
  in the refrigerator to help prevent them from getting too soft.
* If you want to store the biscuits for longer than a few days, you can also freeze them. To do this, wrap the biscuits
  tightly in plastic wrap or aluminum foil, and then place them in a resealable freezer bag. When you're ready to eat
  them, thaw the biscuits at room temperature or in the refrigerator, and then enjoy.
* It's important to note that the quality of the biscuits may decline slightly over time, as the texture may become a
  little less tender and the flavor may become less pronounced. However, if stored properly, the biscuits should still
  be tasty for several days or even up to a week.
