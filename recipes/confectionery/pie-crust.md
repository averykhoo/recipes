# TODO: Flaky Pie Crust

https://www.inspiredtaste.net/22662/flaky-pie-crust-recipe/

note: the crust was a bit too thin with half a recipe

another note: it works without any water, but it's a bit more difficult to roll out. roll it out on a large sheet of
clingfilm, then use that to transfer it into the pie dish.

lazy to edit so pasting the whole page here first

## ingredients

* 400 grams all-purpose flour (or pastry flour, or 1 part cake to 2 parts plain)
    * this is used in 2 parts below
* 1 teaspoon kosher salt or use 1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt
* 1 tablespoon sugar, optional
* 250 grams very cold unsalted butter, cut into 1/2-inch【1.27 cm】 cubes (2 sticks)
* (optional) an ice cube or two

## Directions for pie dough

1. Add 1 ½ cups (250g) flour, salt, and sugar (optional) to a food processor. Pulse 2 to 3 times until combined. The
   remaining cup of flour will be added later.
2. Scatter butter cubes over flour and process until a dough or paste begins to form, about 15 seconds.
   (There should be no uncoated flour).
    * also, blending in an ice cube as soon as it's fully mixed helps speed things up
3. Scrape bowl, redistribute the flour-butter mixture then add remaining 1 cup (150g) of flour. Pulse 4 to 5 times
   until flour is evenly distributed. (Dough should look broken up and a little crumbly).
4. Using a rubber spatula, press the dough into itself. The crumbs should begin to form larger clusters.
   If you pinch some of the dough and it holds together, it's ready.
   If the dough falls apart, add 2 to 4 more tablespoons of water and continue to press until dough comes together.
5. Remove dough from bowl and place in a mound on a clean surface. Work the dough just enough to form a ball.
   Cut the ball in half then form each half into discs.
   Wrap each disc with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour and up to 2 days.
   You can also freeze it for up to 3 months (just thaw it overnight in the fridge before using it).

## Directions for blind baking:

1. prepare pie tin by lining the bottom with parchment paper
2. roll dough out on clingfilm, then invert onto the pie tin
3. arrange neatly and fold the sides down to an even height
4. dock (stab the bottom with a fork) before chilling or freezing
5. line with parchment or foil, then pour over sugar or baking beans, pressing it into the corners
   * consider wrapping the edge in foil to prevent burning
6. bake at 200c for 15 mins
7. remove paper and sugar very carefully - the sugar is very hot,
   and the pie dough may be stuck to the bottom of the paper
    * if the dough stuck, just scrape it off into the pie tin, align and press it into place, then dock again
8. bake at 200c for 5 more mins
9. store sugar (very carefully, it's hot)
