# TODO: Flaky Pie Crust

https://www.inspiredtaste.net/22662/flaky-pie-crust-recipe/

note: the crust was a bit too thin with half a recipe

another note: it works without any water, but it's a bit more difficult to roll out. roll it out on a large sheet of
clingfilm, then use that to transfer it into the pie dish.

lazy to edit so pasting the whole page here first

## ingredients

* 350 grams all-purpose flour (or pastry flour, or 1 part cake to 2 parts plain)
    * this is used in 2 parts below
* 1 teaspoon kosher salt or use 1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt
* 1 tablespoon sugar, optional
* 250 grams very cold unsalted butter, cut into 1/2-inch【1.27 cm】 cubes (2 sticks)
* 0 to 8 tablespoons ice water (skip)

## DIRECTIONS (WHEN USING FOOD PROCESSOR)

1. Add 1 ½ cups【355 mL】 flour, salt, and sugar (optional) to a food processor. Pulse 2 to 3 times until combined. The
   remaining cup of flour will be added later.
    * note: this shouldn't matter much
    * also, blending in an ice cube as soon as it's fully mixed helps speed things up
2. Scatter butter cubes over flour and process until a dough or paste begins to form, about 15 seconds. (There should be
   no uncoated flour).
3. Scrape bowl, redistribute the flour-butter mixture then add remaining 0.5 - 1 cup of flour. Pulse 4 to 5 times
   until flour is evenly distributed. (Dough should look broken up and a little crumbly).
4. Transfer to a medium bowl then sprinkle ice water over mixture — start with 1 tablespoon and add from there. Using a
   rubber spatula, press the dough into itself. The crumbs should begin to form larger clusters. If you pinch some of
   the dough and it holds together, it's ready. If the dough falls apart, add 2 to 4 more tablespoons of water and
   continue to press until dough comes together.
5. Remove dough from bowl and place in a mound on a clean surface. Work the dough just enough to form a ball. Cut the
   ball in half then form each half into discs. Wrap each disc with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour and
   up to 2 days. You can also freeze it for up to 3 months (just thaw it overnight in the fridge before using it).
6. roll out and arrange in a pie tin about 2cm high (the pie is quite flat), then stab with a fork
7. freeze in pie tin after docking with a fork. blind bake at 200c/400f for 20 mins, with baking beans

## Directions for blind baking:

1. stab with fork when the dough is not frozen, otherwise the dough will crack
2. line with parchment at the botton
3. line with parchment or foil, then pour over sugar, pressing it into the corners
4. bake at 200c for 15 mins
5. remove parchment and (very hot) sugar
6. bake at 200c for 5 more mins
7. store sugar (very carefully, it's hot)
