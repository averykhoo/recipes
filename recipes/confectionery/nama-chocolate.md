2. pour into a square container (about 13cm x 13cm) lined on the bottom with baking paper
3. lay another sheet of baking paper on top, and remove any bubbles - helps keep it flat and smooth
4. cool in the fridge until quite solid

6. let sit *outside* the fridge for a couple minutes just before serving
