# nama chocolate *a la royce*

## ingredients

* 100g dark chocolate (70g `callebaut 70-30-38` + 30g `callebaut 811`)
* 66g cream (millac 38% fat) (more next time)
    * if the cream isn't 38% fat, make it up with some butter
* 1/8 tsp vanilla
* note: add a pinch of salt next time
* cocoa powder for dusting

## directions

1. melt and mix all ingredients (e.g., over a bain marie) to form a ganache
2. pour into a square container (about 13cm x 13cm) lined on the bottom with baking paper
3. lay another sheet of baking paper on top, and remove any bubbles - helps keep it flat and smooth
4. cool in the fridge until quite solid
5. trim the edges, cut into ~2x2cm squares (about 36 total), and toss with cocoa powder
6. let sit *outside* the fridge for a couple minutes just before serving
