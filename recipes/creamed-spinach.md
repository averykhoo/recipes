* Yields 4 Servings

## Ingredients

* 1 pound / 500g baby spinach
* 1 tbsp Butter
* 1 tbsp Flour
* 0.25 cups heavy cream / 0.5 cups milk or stock
* Salt and Pepper
* (Optional) pinch of nutmeg, chopped shallot, couple cloves of garlic

## Directions

1. Stem the Spinach: Pull the stems out of the spinach.
2. Wash the leaves in a bowl of water to loosen any dirt.
3. Boil the leaves for a few minutes in a large pot of salted water until spinach is wilted and partially tender.
4. Remove to a large bowl of ice water. This stops the cooking and sets the green color.
5. When it is chilled, remove by big handfuls and squeeze out as much water as you can.
   **This can all be done the day before and kept in the refrigerator**
6. Briefly saute the spinach in a frying pan with 1 tablespoon of butter, to evaporate the moisture.
7. Stir in 1 tablespoon of flour and continue to slow saute for about 2 minutes until flour is cooked.
8. Remove from heat and blend in heavy cream.
9. Bring to simmer again for two minutes or so, blending in drops of more cream if the spinach seems too thick.
10. Season carefully with salt and pepper (a little goes a long way). Blend in a bit more butter if you’d like.
11. (Optional) To make a gratin, stir in half a cup of cream cheese and top with half a cup of gruyere, then bake.
