## ingredients

* 1 heaped Tbsp (20g) butter
* 2 heaped Tbsp (20g) flour
* 1 cup milk
* pinch or two of salt
* pepper
* nutmeg
* (optional) dijon mustard

## directions

1. fry equal weights of butter and flour until cooked and blonde, and smells lightly nutty
2. while whisking quickly, slowly pour in the milk
3. bring to a boil, keep stirring to prevent it sticking to the bottom
4. add salt, (white) pepper, nutmeg powder, maybe a touch of mustard
5. cover surface with clingfilm to prevent it from forming a skin

notes:

* too thick? add milk. too thin? boil it down.
* escoffier's recipe involved onion and veal
* alternatively use hot milk and cold roux, but never both hot or both cold
  * e.g. boil a bay leaf and half an onion studded with whole cloves in the milk, then strain out
* add (optional egg yolk and) 1 cup of cheese for a mornay sauce
  * double the cheese to make mac and cheese sauce (and optionally add a little onion to the roux) (and optionally replace nutmeg with cayenne or paprika) (and optionally top with breadcrumbs and parmesan and bake https://youtu.be/EMcN2ZzEXGQ)
* halve the milk and fold in a beaten egg white (with cream of tartar) and bake at 190C to make a souffle
