Ingredients:

* (optional) bunch of garlic chives (koo chye), cut on a bias
* 3 cloves garlic, pressed
* 1 cup cream, half-and-half, or full-fat milk
* 1 pinch nutmeg powder
* 1 small pinch clove powder
* 1/4 teaspoon salt
* 3-4 small potatoes (about 400g), sliced thinly
* (optional) 1/2 cup grated cheese (usually Gruyere)

Instructions:

1. Press the garlic cloves and simmer in cream in a large pan over medium heat. Also add chives, if using.
2. Add the nutmeg and clove powder and stir to combine.
3. Add the thinly sliced potatoes to the pan and stir to coat in the milk mixture.
4. Simmer the potatoes in the milk until they are cooked through, about 10-15 minutes.
5. Transfer the potatoes to a casserole dish, layering them horizontally.
6. Pour the cream (or milk mixture) over the potatoes. They should be just covered - if not, add a bit more milk.
7. If using, sprinkle the grated Gruyere cheese over the top of the potatoes.
8. Bake the casserole at 190 degrees Celsius for 30 minutes.
9. Serve hot.
