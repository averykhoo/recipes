##  Ingredients & Instructions

*   400g cake (pastry/top) flour
*   400g bread (strong) flour
*   2.5 teaspoons baking powder
*   2 teaspoons baking soda
*   1.5 teaspoons fine salt 

1.  Sift flours, baking soda, baking powder and salt into a medium bowl.
    Set aside.
      
*   500g unsalted butter (2 slabs) 
*   400g white sugar
*   450g light-brown sugar

2.  Using a mixer fitted with paddle attachment, cream butter and sugars together until very light, about 5 minutes.
    Use a huge bowl. (Food processor, blender, hand mixer, or a fork or two otherwise.)
      
*   4 large eggs (60g each)
*   2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract

3.  (If mixing by hand, switch to a wooden spoon, minimum diameter 1cm (3/8 inch) or the spoon might break.)
    (If butter was browned, wait for it to cool first.)
    Add eggs, one at a time, mixing well after each addition.
    Stir in the vanilla.
    There should be about 2.35 to 2.4 kg of dough.

4.  Optional step (more important if skipping the long wait below): 
    Let mixture stand 3 minutes, then whisk for 30 seconds. 
    Repeat process of resting and whisking two more times until mixture is thick, smooth, and shiny.

5.  Reduce speed to low, add (sift in if by hand) dry ingredients and mix until just combined.
    (About 5 to 10 seconds in a mixer / blender)
      
*   Either: 1 kg coverture ~60% baking chocolate, coarsely chopped
*   Or: 700g nuts + 500g chocolate

6.  (If splitting the batch into nut and no-nut cookies, try to prepare and store them separately for the sake of people with nut allergies)
    Drop chocolate (and nut) pieces in and incorporate them without breaking them too much.

7.  Wrap dough tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 24-36 hours. Try not to skip this step.

8.  When ready to bake, preheat oven to 170°C. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a nonstick baking mat. Set aside. 
    (Ideally, prepare 2 trays and 3 sheets of parchment paper.)

9.  Scoop 50g balls of dough (about a golf ball) onto baking paper, making sure to turn horizontally any chocolate pieces that are poking up; it will make for a more attractive cookie.

*   Several pinches fancy salt (sea salt is nice, or colored salt, or fleur de sel, or pyramid salt, etc)

10. Sprinkle lightly with the salt.

11. Bake one tray at a time until golden brown but still soft (select “convection” then “oven bake”).
    Cookies will appear to be too soft, but will harden significantly as it cools.
    (the following settings optimized for the Sharp AX-1500V oven, bottom tray only)

| Cookie Weight | Cookie Diameter | Baking Time | Cookies Per Tray | Shape        |
|---------------|-----------------|-------------|------------------|--------------|
| 10 g          | 4.5 cm          | 8.5 mins    | 15 (rectilinear) | [⋮⋮⋮⋮⋮]  |        
| 25 g          | 6.5 cm          | 9 mins      | 9 (rectilinear)  | [⋮⋮⋮]     |       
| 50 g          | 8 cm            | 12 mins     | 5 (2-1-2)        | [ ˙̣ ⋅ ˙̣ ]    | 
| 100 g         | 12 cm           | 15 mins     | 4 (zigzag)       | [.˙.˙]       |  
            
12. Transfer sheet to a wire rack for ~10 minutes, then slip cookies onto another rack to cool a bit more.
    Cookie will be soft and fragile for the first few minutes out of the oven, so be careful not to break it.

13. Repeat with remaining dough, or reserve dough, refrigerated, for baking remaining batches the next day.

14. Store in the fridge, separated with baking paper.
    Optionally toast before serving.

##  To-do:
*   Maybe try a pinch or two of nutmeg?
*   Add notes about equipment to the start of the recipe
*   Cookie seems less crispy than it should be, maybe the oven is getting less hot now that it’s older?
    Possibly due to thermocouple drift since the oven is pretty old, so maybe try raising the temp back to 180
