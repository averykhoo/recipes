about 50-65g dried pasta per person (500g packet of dried pasta usually feeds 8-10)
and pepper is important too

## ingredients, part 1

[//]: # (TODO: this is pretty much passata and could be a separate page)

* 1-2 carrots
* 1 onion
* 1-2 stalks celery
* 1 red capsicum, cored
* 1kg cherry tomatoes
* 5 cloves garlic, peeled
* 1 cup chicken or beef stock
* optional (fresh?) herbs
* salt and pepper

## ingredients, part 2

* 100g-200g bacon, sliced very thinly and cut into small bits
  * to make this halal, substitute with 50g beef fat plus a bit of salt
* 250g ground mutton
* 250g ground beef
* 100-200g chicken livers, blended into a liquid paste
* herbs & spices (oregano, fresh rosemary, parsley, bay, pepper, nutmeg, ...?)
* 1 tsp worcestershire sauce, of half the amount of fish sauce
* (as necessary) 1 Tbsp tomato paste
* 1/4 to 1 cup wine
* optional:
    * up to 1/2 cup milk, pinch of nutmeg
    * gelatin
    * mushroom
    * parmesan

## directions, part 1

1. blend/dice/mince the carrot, onion, celery, and capsicum
2. fry with little to no oil until well cooked through
3. add chopped tomatoes and garlic and cook, covered, until garlic is fragrant
4. add stock and optional herbs and cook, covered, until it looks about done
5. reserve in an airtight container in the fridge for up to a week, or in the freezer for maybe a month

## directions, part 2

1. fry the bacon to render the fat
2. add the rest of the meat and fry until no longer raw or wet (if the meat releases water, boil it off)
3. turn off the heat and stir in the chicken liver until everything is coated
4. mix in herbs, tomato sauce from part 1, and a dash of worcestershire
5. if the sauce isn't tomatoey enough, scoot everything over to the side, fry the tomato paste, then mix in
6. cook without stirring much until browned at the bottom of the pan
7. deglaze with wine and stir well to combine; repeat these 2 steps until you've added all the wine you want to add
8. add milk and stir, letting it be fully absorbed

## notes

* to do this in one pan: fry the soffrito dry, render bacon, add meat, then tomatoes, garlic, herbs, spices
* for lasagna: omit milk and nutmeg, and consider using more (maybe 2x?) tomatoes
* any color of wine will work, but red gives the final sauce a nicer color

use for:
* pasta bolognese
* lasagna
* chili cheese fries
