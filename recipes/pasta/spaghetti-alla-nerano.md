Ingredients

* 1 quart【950 mL】 sunflower oil, or as needed, for deep frying
* 6 medium green zucchini
* 4 ounces【113 g】 spaghetti
* 2 tablespoons olive oil
* 1 pinch salt
* 2 basil leaves, torn into small pieces
* 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
* 5 tablespoons grated Pecorino Romano cheese
* 3 tablespoons grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese
* black pepper to taste
* optional 1 clove garlic
* optional pat of butter to finish

Directions

1. Slice zucchini into 1/8-inch【3.2 mm】rounds.
2. Place sunflower oil in a deep fryer and heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
3. Add some zucchini to the hot oil and deep-fry until lightly browned, 4 to 5 minutes.
4. Transfer to a single layer on paper towels to drain and repeat to cook remaining zucchini.
5. Let zucchini cool to room temperature.
6. Transfer cooled zucchini to a bowl. Cover and refrigerate, 8 hours to overnight.
7. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally,
   until it's 2 minutes away from being tender yet firm to the bite, 9 to 10 minutes.
8. As you are cooking the spaghetti, heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat.
9. Add zucchini and salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until it starts to release juices, soften, and break down,
   3 to 5 minutes.
10. Add a couple splashes of the pasta water to the zucchini, but don't overdo it.
11. Break zucchini into small pieces with the edge of a spoon or spatula.
12. Reduce heat to low and toss in basil and butter; stir until butter melts.
13. Grab spaghetti with tongs and transfer it right into the sauce; stir until coated.
14. Mix in Pecorino Romano and Parmigiano-Reggiano cheeses.
15. Add a final splash of pasta water and adjust salt if needed.
16. Serve with more grated cheese and fresh basil.

Chef's Notes

* Use any zucchini from your garden; different types and sizes are fine.
* If your deep fryer is small, you can use a Dutch oven instead and fry more zucchini at a time.
* You can add a clove of minced garlic when making the sauce if you want.
* Use grated provolone del Monoco cheese if you can find it. I used 1/2 Parmesan cheese and 1/2 Toma cheese.
