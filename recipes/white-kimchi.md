## Ingredients

Cabbage:

* 1.5kg napa cabbage cores, quartered and washed
* 2.5 tablespoons salt

Fillings:

* 250g Korean radish (or daikon), peeled and julienned
* 1 carrot, julienned
* 0.75 cup buchu (Asian chives), cut into 1 inch pieces
* 3-4 dried jujubes, seeded and julienned
* 2 fresh chestnuts, peeled and julienned
* 2 tablespoons pine nuts
* Several silgochu (chili skin) strands
* 0.5 red bell pepper, cored, seeded, and julienned
* (optional) green onion or scallions, julienned
* (optional) parsley
* (optional) some apple or pear, julienned

Pickling liquid:

* 1 medium (about 2 cups) pear (or apple), peeled and cored
* 4-8 garlic cloves
* 0.5 cup onion
* 0.5-1 inch ginger
* 1 tablespoon salt mixed in 2-4 cups water to form a brine
* (optional) 1 tbsp fish sauce

## Directions

1. Sprinkle salt evenly between the cabbage leaves, and leave to sit for 1 to 4 hours, turning every 20 minutes
2. Rinse out excess salt
3. Combine fillings in a bowl
4. Blend pear, garlic, onion, and ginger in a food processor until creamy, and pour the mix into a cloth pouch
5. Put the pouch into the bowl of brine, and squeeze to extract the juice
6. Take a cabbage quarter and spread some of the vegetable fillings between each leaf
7. Put it into a container, such as a glass jar, or Korean earthenware pot. Repeat with the remaining cabbage
8. Pour the brine over the kimchi so it’s submerged
9. ~~Cover and let sit at room temperature until it starts fermenting, which should be between 1 to 2 days~~
   (Just keep an eye on the kimchi and taste it now and then: when the brine turns sour, it’s fermenting)
10. Store it to the fridge, which will slow down the fermentation process. It will keep for about 1 month. Serve cold.
