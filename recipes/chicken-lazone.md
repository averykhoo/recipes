This recipe comes from the restaurant "Brennan's" located in New Orleans.
No one has to know how simple and quick it is.
I posted this recipe exactly as it was in the book, however, if you like a little "heat" please feel free to add some
cayenne pepper to taste.

Ingredients

* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1.5 teaspoons chili powder
* 1.5 teaspoons onion powder
* 2 teaspoons garlic powder
* 4 whole boneless skinless chicken breasts
* 0.25 cup butter, divided
* 0.5 cup heavy cream

Directions

1. Combine the seasonings and coat chicken breasts.
2. In large saute pan melt half of the butter and cook chicken over medium heat for about 7 to 8 minutes, turning once.
3. Pour the cream into the skillet and lower the heat.
4. Simmer for several minutes, stirring until the sauce thickens then add the remaining butter.
5. When butter is melted place chicken breasts on four plates and top with the sauce.
