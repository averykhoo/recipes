# Japanese-ish Beef Meuniere

* 200g frozen fatty sliced beef meant for yakiniku (about 9 slices)
* 1 tsp pepper
* 1 tbsp plain flour
* 1 tsp shoyu
* 2 tsp mirin
* 2 tsp red wine
* 1-2 tsp butter

Instructions:

1. Season the frozen beef slices with pepper and lightly sprinkle / dust them with flour.
2. Fry the beef over medium heat (either dry or with a pat of butter) until just barely cooked through.
   It only takes 10 seconds to cook each side. Remove the beef from the pan and set it aside in a bowl.
3. Turn off the heat. Add shoyu and mirin to the pan and swish that around a little to help cool the pan.
4. Pour 1-3 teaspoons of wine into the pan and deglaze. Make sure to get the brown bits off the sides too.
5. Stir in the butter until it has melted and the sauce has thickened slightly.
6. Add the beef and its accumulated juices back into the pan and toss gently to mix and coat with the sauce.
   The sauce will thicken slightly and become more gravy-like as it is mixed with the flour coating on the beef.
