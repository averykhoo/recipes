* 3-4 cloves garlic, minced
* about half a carrot, julienned (sliced into thin strips)
* half a lettuce, sliced about 1cm thick, the end cuts need to be cut again because they'll be too huge otherwise
* 6 small (dried and rehydrated for 30 mins) mushrooms
* 130g dried bee hoon, soaked for about 20 mins
* 1 can pork trotters, 2 would be better
* about 1 pork trotter can full of water (used to soak mushrooms), which is a good way to wash in the last bits of pork
* 1 Tbsp shoyu
* 1 Tbsp dark soy sauce
* 1-2 stalks spring onion, sliced thin

1. Pre-soak the bee hoon and mushrooms.
2. Fry the garlic, carrots, and mushrooms in a pan until fragrant.
3. Stir in the lettuce and cook until it has just wilted.
4. Add the pork trotters, water (used to soak mushrooms), shoyu, and dark soy sauce. Stir and bring it to a simmer.
5. Add the soaked bee hoon and cook until it has absorbed most of the sauce.
6. Serve with spring onions on top.
