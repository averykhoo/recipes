# Pork Trotter Bee Hoon

* 3-4 cloves garlic, minced
* about half a carrot, julienned (sliced into thin strips)
* half a lettuce, sliced about 1cm thick, the end cuts need to be cut again because they'll be too huge otherwise
* 6 small (dried and rehydrated for 30 mins) mushrooms
* 130g dried bee hoon, soaked for about 20 mins
* 1 can pork trotters, 2 would be better
* about 1 pork trotter can full of water, which is a good way to wash in the last bits of pork
* 1 tbsp shoyu
* 1 tbsp dark soy sauce
* 1-2 stalks spring onion, sliced thin

1. Pre-soak the bee hoon and mushrooms.
2. Fry the garlic and carrots in a pan until fragrant.
3. Add the mushrooms and stir-fry for a minute.
4. Add the pork trotters, water, shoyu, and dark soy sauce. Bring it to a simmer.
5. Stir in the lettuce and cook until it has just wilted.
6. Add the soaked bee hoon and cook until it has absorbed most of the sauce.
7. Serve with spring onions on top.
