## Ingredients

* lots of spinach / fenugreek - about 400g, stems okay
* salt
* lots of paneer - about 150-200g
* ghee
* 10 cloves garlic, 1 cm ginger, 1 medium onion, 200g tomato
* ~~chili,~~ a teaspoon each of powdered cumin, cinnamon, turmeric, cardamom, garam masala, coriander
  * if using whole cardamom, toast/fry and crush it, then remove the skin
* some clove, bay (powder), black pepper
* tablespoon or two of fenugreek leaves, half to one cup cream, maybe yoghurt
* tablespoon of cashew paste for thickening?

## Directions

1. blanch spinach and fenugreek (mustard leaves) in salty water. Blanching removes the raw, bitter, and metallic flavor
   of spinach. Drain, chop, and set aside.
2. fry the paneer in ghee until golden and slightly firm (i.e. less crumbly), and reserve
3. fry herbs and spices until aromatic
4. add garlic, ginger, onion, and tomato, and fry over low heat (do not brown, or the dish won't be vibrant green)
5. if aiming for the consistency of palak paneer, blend the whole thing until smooth.
6. add paneer, stock, cream, yoghurt, dried fenugreek leaves. You'll get that restaurant-style palak paneer flavor by
   adding dry fenugreek leaves
