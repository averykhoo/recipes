## Ingredients:

* 2 large / 3 medium eggplants (2 pounds = 900 grams)
* 1 tablespoon olive oil
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 2 cloves of garlic, pressed or minced
* 1 tablespoon of lemon juice (use 1 if you're not a fan of sour food)
* 1/4 cup of tahini <- warning: nut allergy
* 1/3 cup of good olive oil
* 2 tablespoons chopped flat-leaf parsley
* 1/4 teaspoon ground cumin
* 1 tablespoon olive oil
* pinch of smoked paprika


## Instructions:

1. Preheat oven to 220Â°C.
2. Slice eggplants in half and brush the cut sides lightly with olive oil.
3. Place the eggplant skin side up on a baking sheet lined with baking paper.
4. Prick the skin all over to allow steam to escape.
5. Roast it in the oven for 30-40 minutes, until tender and slightly browned.
6. Let the eggplant cool, then scrape out the insides with a spoon into a strainer over a bowl.
7. Mix in the salt, then allow excess water to drain into the bowl. Discard the water and wipe the bowl.
8. In the bowl, mix the eggplant, minced garlic, and lemon juice. Stir until the eggplant breaks down.
9. Fully incorporate the tahini.
10. Slowly drizzle in the olive oil while stirring, until all the olive oil is incorporated.
11. Keep mixing until smooth and well combined.
12. Stir in the parsley and cumin.
13. Adjust seasonings to taste - you may want to add more lemon juice or salt.
14. To serve, swirl in a serving bowl, drizzle over some olive oil, and sprinkle over a pinch of paprika.

### Notes:

* Try roasting garlic with the eggplant. About 3x as much garlic will be needed.
* Parsley can be substituted with celery leaves.
* A couple drops of liquid smoke rounds up the flavor, since we didn't actually bbq the eggplant.
* Smaller eggplants have less irritating seeds, so don't go for a single gigantic 900g eggplant.
* Oil can be replaced with plain low-fat yoghurt, if NYT is to be believed.
  * More likely - add 1/4 cup yoghurt, reduce the oil to 1/4 cup, reduce the lemon juice to 1 tbsp.
* Toasted pine nuts are another possible garnish.
* Lemon juice can be partly substituted with sumac powder?
