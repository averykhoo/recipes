# Recipes

Recipes for real actually-edible food

## Structure (tentative)

* [`/curated-untested`](/curated-untested) contains recipes that look interesting but haven't been tested
* [`/in-progress`](/in-progress) contains recipes that have been made at least once but have missing details
* [`/recipes`](/recipes) contains the main bulk of the recipes

## todo: use collapsible markdown
