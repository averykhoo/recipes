With 5 blocks of cream cheese in this bad boy, be sure to use both hands to carry the pan...it is HEAVY!
My daughter, Erin, was actually the one to try this recipe out while she was living at home with us.
Well, okay, she didn’t make it for her mom and dad – she made it for a guy she was dating.

He didn’t last, but the recipe sure did…it is fantastic!
Despite the weight of the pan, the texture is still light and not overly solid.
The citrus adds just a hint of flavor, and makes this one really good with a fruit topping (but I also love it just plain).

Ingredients
Graham cracker crust:
*   1 cup​ graham cracker crumbs
*   3 tablespoons butter
*   3 tablespoons sugar

cheesecake filling:
*   2.5 lbs (5x 8-ounce blocks) (1.15kg) cream cheese, softened (I don’t recommend reduced or no-fat for this one)
*   1.75 cups​ sugar
*   zest of 1 lemon
*   zest of 1 orange, or 1/2 teaspoon orange extract
*   1 teaspoon vanilla extract
*   3 tablespoons flour
*   5 eggs + 2 egg yolks
*   0.5 cups​ sour cream

Directions:
For crust:
1.  Butter the bottom and sides of a 9-inch springform pan.
2.  In a mixing bowl, combine graham crumbs, butter and sugar – mix well.
3.  Press crumbs into bottom and halfway up sides of pan and bake at 375F (190C) until golden, about 8 minutes.
4.  Set aside to cool while you prepare the cheesecake filling.
5.  NOTE: If you haven't invested in a pestle yet, go out and get yourself one... 
    pressing crusts into pans/muffin tins is SO MUCH easier with that little tool!

For cheesecake filling:
1.  Preheat oven to 500F (260C) degrees. (seriously 260C???)
2.  In a large mixing bowl with an electric mixer, combine cream cheese, sugar, zests, and vanilla ;
    beat until light and creamy.
3.  Add the flour, then the eggs and the additional yolks, one at a time, mixing well after each addition.
4.  Add the sour cream and mix until smooth.
5.  Pour mixture into prepared pan and bake for 12 minutes at 500.
    Reduce oven temp to 200 and bake for 1 hour.
6.  DON'T PANIC when you see how brown the top of the cheesecake becomes... 
    this is what it SHOULD do.
7.  Turn off the oven and open the oven door;
    allow cheesecake to cool in the oven for an hour before transferring the pan to a cooking rack to cool completely before refrigerating.
8.  It is best if refrigerated overnight or at least 10 hours
9.  Serve plain or with a strawberry sauce.


Optional Strawberry Sauce:
*   2 pints​ fresh strawberries, stem removed, fruit chopped into large chunks
*   0.75 cup​ sugar
*   1 cup​ water
*   1 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest
*   1 teaspoon finely grated orange zest
*   2 tablespoons Grand Marnier liqueur

1.  In a saucepan, combine strawberries, sugar, water, and zest;
    cook until strawberries are soft and liquid is thickened, about 10 minutes.
2.  Stir in the liqueur and cook 1 more minute.
3.  Serve chilled or at room temperature
