# Nacho Cheese Sauce

* from [The Burger Lab](https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2010/09/cheese-sauce-for-cheese-fries-and-nachos.html)
* scaled approximately by 110% and converted to metric

## Ingredients

* 250g extra sharp cheddar
* 1 tablespoon cornstarch
* 370g evaporated milk (Carnation milk)
* (Optional) up to 2 tablespoons hot sauce

## Directions

1. Add cheese and cornstarch to large bowl.
   Toss to combine.
   Transfer to medium saucepan.

2. Add evaporated milk and hot sauce.
   Cook over low heat, stirring constantly with whisk until melted, bubbly, and thickened (about 5 minutes).
   Mixture will look thin and grainy at first but will thicken and come together after heating.
   Thin to desired consistency with additional evaporated milk.
   Serve immediately with fries, tortilla chips, burgers, or hot dogs.

3. To reheat the sauce, microwave it on high heat, stopping and stirring every 30 seconds until it's fully melted.

## Notes

* This cheese sauce is gooey and tangy.
* For a spicier version, substitute half the cheddar cheese with Pepper Jack
  and add 2-3 minced pickled jalapeños, or to taste.
* based on [this recipe](https://modernistcuisine.com/recipes/melty-queso-dip/) from Modernist Cuisine,
  sodium citrate can also be used to dissolve cheese
    * while sodium citrate isn't common, it can be synthesized by mixing sodium bicarbonate and citric acid
      in [appropriate proportions](https://forums.egullet.org/topic/145871-any-chemists-here-would-like-to-synthesize-sodium-citrate-in-a-pinch/?do=findComment&comment=1939016)
    * 3NaHCO3 (252g) + C6H8O7 (192g) -> Na3C6H5O7.2H2O (294g) + H2O (18g) + 3CO2
      (but trisodium citrate dihidrate is often used for food, instead of anhydrous)

# [Nuage Chocolat – Chocolate Cloud](https://parischezsharon.com/2020/04/nuage-chocolat-chocolate-cloud.html)

* 4-6 servings

My followers know I love chocolate very much: Chocolate cakes, chocolate cookies and everything related to chocolate.
In a city where chocolate is revered as an art form, it's as if it “flows” in the Seine River!
One of my favorite desserts is chocolate mousse, which I discovered far before my culinary journey in Paris.

Actually, the first time I tasted it was in my childhood when the chocolate mousse was sold at the neighborhood
supermarket in plastic cups.
After one taste, I felt like I won the lottery! Over the years, I have tried many chocolate mousse recipes, but this
recipe is my favorite.
It is very simple to make.
With an airy and light texture, it is a dessert that leaves you wanting a second helping.
You'll be asking for more!

Ingredients

* 100 g fresh milk
* 190 g dark chocolate, chopped 70%
* 25 g egg yolks (usually from 1 egg L)
* 175 g egg whites (usually from 5 eggs L)
* 40 g caster sugar

Preparation

1. Heat the milk until simmering
2. Melt the chocolate in a double boiler or the microwave.
3. Pour the hot milk over the chocolate in a bowl, stir to make a smooth cream.
   Set aside to cool.
4. Pour egg yolks into chocolate cream and whisk.
5. Beat egg whites with sugar until firm peaks form.
6. Fold egg whites into the chocolate cream.
   Fold through until incorporated (not too many folds).
7. Divide mixture between 4- 6 small glasses, or pour it into a centeral vessel.
   Refrigerate for at least 4 hours, preferably overnight.

9. Enjoy your delicious choux pastry with custard cream!
10. Note: The recipe is based on the provided video transcript and may require adjustments based on personal preferences
    and cooking conditions.

Notes:

1. After filling in the cream, the choux gets damp easily. 
2. To keep the crispness the longest, you have no choice but to fill it with cream every time you eat it.
3. If you open the oven door while baking, the sugar will collapse (Do not open the oven)

# Flapjacks

From https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R75oLxw292o

Makes one 9 x 12-inch tin (about 16-20 pieces )

* 8 oz (200 grams) salted butter
* 4 Tbsp golden syrup (you can substitute honey or maple syrup but it won't be authentic)
* 8 oz (200 grams) granulated sugar
* 4oz (100 grams) oats
* 4oz (100 grams) self rising flour
* 6oz (150 grams) cornflakes (lightly crushed)

optional:

* Nuts
* Dried fruit
* Chocolate chips

1. Melt the butter and syrup together.
2. Mix the dry ingredients together in a large bowl. Add the melted butter/golden syrup mixture and mix well
3. Spread evenly in a greases swiss roll tin and press down firmly.
4. Bake in a moderate oven 190c/ 350f for 20 mins.
5. Cut into fingers while still warm.

Instructions from video:

1. Combine Dry Ingredients: In a large mixing bowl, mix together the flour, sugar, oats, and cornflakes.
2. Melt Wet Ingredients: In a saucepan, melt the butter and golden syrup together.
3. Mix Everything: Pour the melted butter and golden syrup mixture into the bowl with the dry ingredients. Stir until
   everything is well combined. For a chewier flapjack, you can add an extra two tablespoons of golden syrup.
4. Prepare for Baking: Press the mixture into a lightly greased sheet pan. Be careful not to press it down too hard, as
   this can make the flapjacks too crunchy.
5. Bake: Bake in the oven for about 20 minutes until golden brown. The top should be soft when it comes out.
6. Cut While Warm: Let the flapjacks cool for a few minutes after taking them out of the oven. It is important to cut
   them into bars while they are still warm, otherwise, they will crumble and break when you try to cut them cold.
7. Cool Completely: Allow the flapjacks to cool completely in the pan before removing and serving them.

# [High As A Kite Biscuits](http://www.grouprecipes.com/56252/high-as-a-kite-biscuits.html)

* From krumkake
* 10 minutes to make
* Serves 8

These are the biscuits I make for biscuits and gravy.
The trick is to work the dough as little as possible, and if you can get the hang of that, you will have biscuits that
bake up higher than anything you've ever seen.

Ingredients

* 2 cups all-purpose flour
* 1 tablespoon baking powder
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1 tablespoon sugar (you can add more if you want a sweeter biscuit)
* 1.5 cups heavy whipping cream (DO NOT SUBSTITUTE - I've tried! These biscuits will only pop up sky-high if you use
  heavy cream - they were flat and not fluffy inside when I tried half-and-half or whole milk)

How to make it

1. In a medium bowl, stir together all ingredients just until the dough forms a ball and ingredients are moistened.
2. Turn the dough out onto a work surface that is dusted with a very small amount of additional flour.
3. Fold the dough in half and press down with the palms of your hands;
   knead the dough this way for 5 to 7 times more, adding just enough flour to keep the dough from sticking to your
   hands and work surface.
4. Gently press dough out to about 0.75-inch thickness;
   cut dough into 3-inch size rounds (use a cookie cutter or a small juice glass).
5. Spray a baking sheet with cooking spray and place biscuits on it, leaving at least 1-inch between each biscuit.
6. Bake at 480 degrees (yes, a very hot oven!) for about 10 minutes, until golden brown on bottoms and tops.
7. You need to watch them closely at the end so you don't burn the bottoms - they require a hot oven, so don't try to
   reduce the heat.
8. Just keep an eye on them and when the tops are nicely golden brown, the bottoms should be, too.
9. If you forget to check them and you end up burning the bottoms (and I HAVE done this!!), just cut off the bottoms of
   the biscuits and they will be fine to eat!
10. Note: For holidays, try using different cookie cutter shapes, like hearts, holly leaf, etc.

# [Meatballs with Cream Sauce](https://www.ikea.com/ms/en_SG/pdf/restaurant/Meatballs_w_creamsauce.pdf)

Without a doubt, meatballs is the best known of all Swedish dishes, traditionally served with potatoes, lingonberry jam
and cream sauce.
The dish is an unexpected meeting of flavours as the lingonberry sweetness contrasts, yet harmonizes, with the
meatballs, while the cream sauce serves as a neutral “mediator” between the two.

This is what you need (30–40 meatballs, serves 4):

* 250 g minced beef
* 250 g minced pork
* 1 egg
* 200–300 ml cream (or milk) and water
* 2.5 tbsp fine chopped onion
* 50 ml unsweetened rusk flour
* 2 boiled potatoes, cold
* 4–5 tbsp butter, margarine or oil
* salt
* white pepper
* (allspice)

This is how you do it:

1. Heat the onion until golden in a couple of tablespoons of lightly browned butter.
2. Mash the potatoes and moisten the rusk flour in a little water.
3. Mix all the ingredients into a smooth farce and flavour generously with salt, white pepper and (optional) finecrushed
   allspice.
4. Shape the farce into round balls and transfer to a floured chopping board, then fry them quite slowly in plenty of
   butter.

This is what you need (cream sauce, serves 4):

* 100 ml double cream
* 200 l water or beef stock
* soy
* salt
* white pepper
* (1 tbsp white flour)

This is how you do it:

1. Swirl out the pan with a couple of decilitres of boiling water or meat stock.
2. Strain the pan juices and dilute with cream.
3. Thicken with white flour if preferred.
4. Season well, and serve this and the meatballs with freshly boiled potatoes, lingonberry jam, a green salad and salted
   or pickled gherkins.

We also have these easy-to-prepare solutions:

* SYLT LINGON - lingonberry jam (400g)
* GURKA INLAGD - pickled cucumber (375g)
* KÖTTBULLAR - swedish meatballs (1kg)
* GRÄDDSÅS - meatball sauce (40g)

# [Ikea Swedish Meatballs](https://www.thrillist.com/recipe/nation/todd-wilbur-ikea-swedish-meatballs-copycat-recipe)

* First-Time Hack
* Active Prep: 20 min
* Inactive Prep: 20 min
* Difficulty: Medium
* Yield: 30 meatballs

I know IKEA is a giant global furniture chain, but before researching these great little balls of meat I wasn't aware
that IKEA is also one of the world's largest food retailers.
At the very top of the list of the most popular menu items at the stores' cafeteria-style IKEA Restaurant & Bistro are
the Swedish Meatballs, which are consumed at a rate of 150 million each year.
The meatballs are moist and delicious and come smothered in a cream sauce and served with a side of lingonberry jam.
But if you don't feel like working your way through the giant rat maze of furniture that is the ingenious layout of each
store to get to a plate of these meatballs, you can now make them at home with very little effort.
The secret is to use ground beef that is 20 percent fat and a food processor to puree all of the ingredients.
If you don't have a food processor, a blender will work to puree the onions, which you can add to the rest of the
ingredients and mix thoroughly with your hands.
I found that a 1 ¼-inch cookie scooper is the best way to form the balls, but you can also form the balls with a
teaspoon measure and your hands-keep your hands thoroughly moistened with water to prevent the meat mixture from
sticking to them.

MEATBALLS
1/3 cup chopped onion
1 large egg
1 egg white
1/3 cup beef broth
2 tablespoons water
½ pound ground beef
(20 percent fat)
½ pound ground pork
½ cup plain bread crumbs
1 teaspoon salt
½ teaspoon white pepper
1/8 teaspoon allspice

CREAM SAUCE
1 ¼ cups beef broth
1/3 cup heavy cream
4 teaspoons cornstarch
1 tablespoon apple juice
¼ teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon garlic powder
1/8 teaspoon onion powder
1/8 teaspoon white pepper
1 bay leaf
2 teaspoons vegetable oil

ON THE SIDE (OPTIONAL)
Lingonberry preserves

Directions

1. Combine the onion, egg, egg white, beef broth, and water in a food processor or blender and mix on high speed for 15
   seconds or until the onion is completely pulverized.
   If using a blender, pour this mixture into a large bowl and combine it with the ground meats, bread crumbs, and
   seasoning.
   Mix thoroughly with your hands.
   If using a food processor, add the ground meats, bread crumbs, and seasoning to the food processor and mix on high
   speed for 30 seconds or until all of the ingredients are combined and the meat has a smooth consistency.
2. Preheat your oven to 350 degrees F.
3. Use a 1/3-ounce cookie scooper (or a teaspoon measure) moistened with water to form balls that are about 1 ¼ inches
   in diameter.
   Moisten your fingers with water to make forming the balls easier.
   Place the balls on a nonstick baking sheet or a baking sheet lined with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat and
   bake for 20 to 25 minutes or until the meatballs are just lightly browned.
   Turn the meatballs over halfway through the cooking time.
4. While the meatballs are baking, make the sauce by whisking all of the ingredients, except the bay leaf, into a small
   saucepan over medium heat.
   When the mixture begins to bubble, add the bay leaf, then reduce the heat and simmer for 6 to 7 minutes or until
   thick.
   Discard the bay leaf.
5. Just before you are ready to serve the meatballs, brown them in a saute pan over medium heat with a couple of
   teaspoons of vegetable oil.
   Serve the meatballs with the cream sauce poured over the top along with a small side of lingonberry preserves, if
   desired.
6. **TIDBITS**: You can freeze the meatballs after they have baked.
   To reheat, add 2 teaspoons of oil to a saute pan over medium heat.
   Cook the meatballs in the pan, stirring often, until browned and hot all the way through.

# [Swedish Meatballs](http://www.grouprecipes.com/20899/swedish-meatballs.html)

* From krumkake
* 40 minutes to make
* Serves 6

This was usually served during the holidays in the Scandinavian family I grew up in.
No one ever got my great-grandmother's recipe (it was the usual "little of this, little of that") but this is as close
as I've come.
The seasoning really depends on how much allspice and nutmeg flavor you prefer, so play around with it until you find
the amount you like.
I tend to go pretty light with it.

Ingredients

* meatballs
    * 0.5 cup unseasoned bread crumbs
    * 1 pound ground chuck
    * 0.5 pound unseasoned ground pork
    * 0.5 cup leftover mashed potatoes
    * 1 egg, beaten
    * 0.5 teaspoon salt
    * 1 teaspoon brown sugar
    * few dashes of black pepper
    * 0.25 teaspoon allspice
    * 0.25 teaspoon nutmeg
    * 0.125 teaspoon ground cloves
    * 0.125 teaspoon ginger
* gravy
    * 1 cup heavy cream or half-and-half
    * 1 cup chicken or beef stock (I prefer stock to broth – more flavor)
* seasonings, as needed – see directions

How to make it

1. Put all meatball ingredients into a large bowl.
   I always find it easiest to use your hands to gently "squish" the mixture, blending all ingredients together well.
2. When well blended, shape into 1” diameter meatballs.
3. Place about 2 tablespoons butter in a large frying pan; brown the meatballs in the butter, turning to brown all
   sides.
4. Cover pan and gently cook over low heat for about 10 minutes, until meat is cooked through.
5. Remove meatballs from pan and keep warm while you prepare the gravy.
6. Stir 2 tablespoons of flour into the pan drippings, whisking together well to remove any clumps of flour.
7. Whisking continually, gradually whisk in heavy cream or half-and-half, and chicken or beef stock
   (either will give you a nice gravy – whatever you have on hand).
8. Season the gravy to your taste with some salt, pepper and just a dash of allspice
   (if needed – the pan drippings will have the flavors from the meatballs, so it all depends on how much you like the
   allspice flavor!).
9. Return meatballs to the gravy and simmer very, very gently for 30 minutes
   (you don't want to break the cream or half-and-half), stirring often.
10. Taste gravy again and adjust seasoning, if needed
    (it probably won't be needed, as the simmering will incorporate the flavors from the meatballs into the gravy and it
    should be fine).
11. This gravy is generally not a thick gravy, but you can thicken more, if desired, with a mixture of cornstarch and
    water.
12. Serve over egg noodles, rice, mashed potatoes, or just on their own, with lots of bread to sop up the gravy!

# [BraveTart's Impossible Pecan Pie](https://www.seriouseats.com/impossible-pecan-pie-video)

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6zRRuBpPnw

I don't know how anything so curdled, coagulated, lumpy, and broken can turn out so delicious, but this pie manages to
defy the odds. The result is half pie, half candy bar, and 100% delicious.

Yield: one 9-inch pie, 8 to 12 slices
Active time: about 30 minutes

* 4 large eggs
* 1 cup, 8 ounces water
* 3 cups, 21 ounces plain or toasted sugar
* 1 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, such as Diamond Crystal
* 1 stick, 4 ounces unsalted butter, cold
* 1 Tablespoon vanilla extract, Scotch, or bourbon
* 2 1/2 cups, 10 ounces pecan halves, raw
* 1 fully baked 9-inch pie crust

1. Before getting started, place the whole eggs in a small bowl, cover with hot tap water and set aside.
2. Combine 8 ounces (1 cup) water with the sugar and salt in a 3-quart stainless steel saucier over medium heat. Stir
   with a fork until the sugar dissolves and the syrup begins to bubble, about 7 minutes. Fill a ramekin with water,
   then use it to wet a pastry brush and wipe all around the edges of the pot, wherever you see sugar crystals or
   splashes of syrup. Re-wet the brush as needed, “washing” around the sides until totally clean. Be generous! Extra
   water will not hurt the pie filling, but sugar crystals will.
3. Crank the heat to medium-high and clip on a digital thermometer. Cook without stirring until the syrup is honey
   colored and 325°, about 12 minutes. Immediately remove from the heat, add the butter all at once, and stir with a
   heat-resistant spatula until the foam subsides. Cool the syrup to 200°, about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally to
   ensure it cools at an even rate. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 350°.
4. Whisk the eggs and vanilla (or booze) in a medium bowl until well combined, then fold in the pecans with a flexible
   spatula. Pour the hot butterscotch over the eggy-pecans and fold with a spatula until the pecans are well coated in
   butterscotch and the eggs are mostly absorbed. The butter will seem to pool out of the mixture, and you may notice a
   few specks of curdled egg, but that's a-okay. Really.
5. Scrape into the prepared crust, and don't worry about trying to spread it into an even layer. Bake 30 minutes, then
   cover the outer ring of crust with a pie shield and continue baking until the filling is bubbling hot and all puffed
   up, about 15 minutes more. When fully baked, the pie will register 210° in the center. Cool at least 2 hours before
   slicing with a chef's knife; prior to that the filling will be warm and runny.
6. Wrapped in plastic, leftovers will keep 3 days at room temperature, or a week in the fridge.

Troubleshooting:

* This recipe depends on an accurate digital thermometer, and when things go wrong you can bet the readings were off.
  This can happen by misreading an analogue thermometer, failing to fully submerge the probe in the syrup, or simply
  when good thermometers go bad (a sad fact of life). It can also happen with meat thermometers not intended for high
  heat, or when the batteries start to fade. Check the temperature range of your thermometer to be certain it can
  register 335°, then test its accuracy by making sure it reads 212° in a pot of boiling water.

# [Recommended Pie Crust Recipe](https://www.seriouseats.com/old-fashioned-flaky-pie-dough-recipe)

Ingredients

* 8 ounces【227 g】 low-protein all-purpose flour, such as Gold Medal Blue Label (1 2/3 cups【394 mL】; 225g), plus more for
  dusting
* 1/2 ounce【14 g】 sugar (1 tablespoon; 15g)
* 1 teaspoon (4g) Diamond Crystal kosher salt; for table salt, use half as much by volume or use the same weight
* 8 ounces【227 g】 unsalted, American-style butter, straight from the fridge (2 sticks; 225g), cold
* 4 ounces【113 g】 cold tap water (1/2 cup【118 mL】; 115g)

Directions

* For the Dough:
    1. Whisk flour, sugar, and salt together in a medium bowl.
    2. Cut butter into cubes no smaller than 1/2 inch【1.27 cm】, and toss with flour mixture to break up the pieces.
    3. With your fingertips, smash each cube flat—that's it! No rubbing or cutting.
    4. Stir in water, then knead dough against sides of the bowl until it comes together in a shaggy ball.
    5. Dough temperature should register between 65 and 70°F (18 and 21°C);
       if not, refrigerate briefly before rolling and folding (see note).
* Make the Layers:
    1. On a generously floured work surface, roll dough into a roughly 10- by 15-inch【38.1 cm】 rectangle.
    2. Fold the 10-inch【25.4 cm】 sides to the center, then close the newly formed packet like a book.
    3. Fold in half once more, bringing the short sides together to create a thick block.
    4. Divide in half with a sharp knife or bench scraper.
    5. Dough temperature should still be somewhere between 65 and 70°F (18 and 21°C);
       if not, refrigerate briefly before proceeding (see note).
* For Single-Crusted Pies:
    1. Using as much flour as needed, roll one piece into a 14-inch【35.56 cm】 circle;
       this size allows ample room to line pie plate, with enough overhang to form a generous border.
    2. At smaller sizes, dough will fall short, making it difficult to shape edges,
       and thicker dough will not crisp as intended. Transfer to 9-inch【22.86 cm】 pie plate;
       dough should be easy to handle, and will not require any special procedures to move.
    3. Dust off excess flour with a pastry brush, using it to nestle dough into corners of pan.
    4. With scissors or kitchen shears, trim edge so that it overhangs by 1 1/4 inches【3.18 cm】.
    5. Fold overhang over itself to create thick border that sits on top edge of pie plate, not below.
    6. Crimp or shape crust as desired. Repeat with remaining dough.
    7. Wrap with plastic and refrigerate at least 2 hours and up to overnight.
    8. Use as directed in your favorite recipe.
* For a Double-Crusted Pie:
    1. Using as much flour as needed, roll one piece into a 14-inch【35.56 cm】 circle;
       this size allows ample room to line pie plate, with enough overhang to form a generous border.
    2. At smaller sizes, dough will fall short, making it difficult to shape edges,
       and thicker dough will not crisp as intended.
    3. Transfer to 9-inch【22.86 cm】 pie plate;
       dough should be easy to handle, and will not require any special procedures to move.
    4. Dust off excess flour with a pastry brush, using it to nestle dough into corners of pan.
    5. With scissors or kitchen shears, trim edge so that it overhangs by 1 1/4 inches【3.18 cm】.
    6. For solid top crust, roll remaining dough as before; for lattice-top pie,
       roll into a 9- by 15-inch【38.1 cm】 rectangle instead.
    7. Transfer to a baking sheet or parchment-lined cutting board.
    8. (The parchment will prevent dough from absorbing any savory odors from the board.)
    9. Wrap both portions in plastic and refrigerate at least 2 hours and up to overnight.
    10. Use as directed in your favorite recipe; after filling pie and sealing crusts together,
        refrigerate 30 minutes before baking.
* For a Blind-Baked Pie:
    1. Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and preheat to 350°F (180°C).
    2. Line pie shell that has been chilled for at least 2 hours (as outlined in Step 3) with a large sheet of aluminum
       foil, pressing so it conforms to curves of plate.
    3. (A second sheet of foil may be needed for full coverage.)
    4. Fill to brim with sugar, transfer to a half sheet pan,
       and bake until fully set and golden around the edges, 60 to 75 minutes.
    5. Fold long sides of foil toward middle, gather short sides,
       and use both hands to carefully transfer sugar to heat-safe bowl. Let sugar cool to room temperature.
    6. If needed, continue baking crust a few minutes more to brown along the bottom.

Special Equipment

* Rolling pin,
* 9-inch【22.86 cm】 pie pan (preferably tempered glass; see note),
* pastry brush

Notes

* Compared to stoneware or heavy enameled ceramic, tempered-glass pie plates conduct heat quickly and evenly, so the
  crust bakes up light and crisp, never greasy or soft.
* When room temperature exceeds 74°F (23°C), kitchen equipment and pantry staples will act as a heat source to the
  butter, creating a sticky dough. If it's warm in your kitchen, take these proactive steps to manage your dough
  temperature.
* See our crash course in mastering pie dough for more tips and troubleshooting.

Make-Ahead and Storage

* The dough can be made ahead of time and refrigerated for up to 24 hours before use. To store it for longer than that,
  the dough can be frozen as a block, rolled, or shaped in a pan. If frozen as a block, dough will still need to
  rest/relax for at least 2 hours after rolling and shaping.

9. The amount of breadcrumbs needed will vary, so trust your instincts.
10. Fill a deep pan with about 1 inch (2.5 cm) of vegetable oil and heat over medium/high.
11. Meanwhile, form the meatball mixture into about 15 polpette.
12. They should be formed into flattened pucks, about 3 inches (7.5 cm) in diameter and 1 inch (2.5 cm) thick.
13. Dust the polpette in bread crumbs.
14. Drop a breadcrumb into the oil to test the temperature.
15. If it starts to bubble and fry right away, the oil is hot enough.
16. Working in batches, carefully drop the eggplant polpette into the pan.
17. Turn them frequently with a couple of forks and fry until browned on both sides—about 4 to 5 minutes in total.
18. Remove to a paper towel to drain.
19. Serve the polpette warm and fresh. Buon appetito!

# Polpette di Ricotta - Vegetarian Ricotta "Meatball" Recipe

https://www.pastagrammar.com/post/polpette-di-ricotta-vegetarian-ricotta-meatball-recipe
Makes: About 20 polpette

Cook Time: 35 minutes

For this recipe, you will need:

* 18 ounces (500 g) ricotta
* 1.75 ounces (50 g) grated pecorino cheese, or to taste
* 1.75 ounces (50 g) grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, or to taste
* 3 large eggs
* About 1 tablespoon fresh parsley, chopped (optional)
* Fresh black pepper
* Salt
* About 1 to 1½ cups (100-150 g) fresh bread crumbs, adjusted to taste
* 4 tablespoons (60 g) extra-virgin olive oil
* 1 clove garlic, peeled


1. In a large mixing bowl combine the ricotta, cheeses, eggs, parsley, plenty of black pepper, and a big pinch of salt.
2. Add about half of the bread crumbs and mix together with a spoon.
3. Gradually continue to add more bread crumbs until the mixture becomes soft and moldable, but no longer sticks to your
   hands when you roll a piece between your palms.
4. Roll the mixture into balls, about 2 inches (5 cm) in diameter.
5. Heat the olive oil and garlic clove in a wide pot over medium heat.
6. When the garlic starts to sizzle, place the ricotta polpette into the bottom of the pot.
7. Gently swirl the pot to move the polpette around and coat them with olive oil.
8. Fill the pot with about ½ inch (1.25 cm) of warm water.
9. Lower the heat, bring the liquid to a simmer, and cover the pot.
10. Cook for 20 minutes, occasionally swirling the pot to stir.
11. If the water evaporates completely, add a little bit more as necessary to keep a simmer going.
12. Serve warm and fresh, drizzled with the pan juices.
13. Buon appetito!

Notes:

1. This recipe works best with real ricotta, not the poor substitute you'll find in a store.

# [Prize Winning Banana Bread](http://www.grouprecipes.com/32963/prize-winning-banana-bread.html)

* From krumkake
* 45 minutes to make
* Serves 12

This recipe won 1st place at the Nicollet County Fair in 1981 and it stills remains our family favorite for banana
bread.
I've modified it ever so slightly over the years, but the end result remains moist and flavorful.

Ingredients

* 0.5 cup butter, softened
* 0.25 cup vegetable oil
* 1 cup white sugar
* 0.5 cup brown sugar
* 2 eggs
* 1.5 cups mashed ripe bananas (I use 3 medium well-ripened bananas)
* 0.5 cup sour cream
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* 2 cups flour
* 1 teaspoon baking soda
* 0.5 teaspoon salt
* additional brown sugar for top of batter

How to make it

1. Mix together butter, oil, sugars and eggs.
2. Add mashed bananas, sour cream and vanilla, stirring together well.
3. Mix in flour, baking soda and salt, stirring until it is well blended.
4. Pour into 1 greased large loaf pan or 3 small loaf pans (I always use 3 of the 7 3/8 x 3 5/8 inch loaf pans - I
   think it gives the best results).
5. Sprinkle additional brown sugar generously over top of batter, using your hand to gently pat some of it into the
   batter.
6. Bake at 325 degrees: large loaf pan for about 1 hour, smaller loaves for about 45 minutes.
7. Allow bread to cool in pans for about 20 minutes, then run a sharp knife around the edges, tap the pan on the counter
   several times to release the bread from the bottom of the pan, then invert pan over a wire rack and let the bread
   fall onto the rack to finish cooling completely.
8. Variations and Suggestions: Add any of the following – miniature chocolate chips, toffee bits, shredded coconut,
   chopped pecans or macadamia nuts.
9. Try toasting your banana bread – spread hot toasted bread with butter and even add a sprinkling of cinnamon and sugar
   and some slices of banana, or top with a combination of honey and peanut butter, or spread hot toasted bread with
   some Nutella…the possibilities are endless!
10. Use slices of banana bread to make your French toast.
    Just dust the finished product with some powdered sugar, or a little powdered sugar glaze, or spread on some
    Nutella, and maple syrup is good on it, too…you've gotta try it!

## Lists


### Unordered list

Cant be marked with `-`, `+` or `*`

```markdown
- First item
- Second item
- Third item
```

```markdown
+ First item
+ Second item
+ Third item
```

```markdown

## Linebreaks

**When you hit enter just once** between two lines, both lines are joined into a single paragraph.

But, if you **leave a blank line between them**, they will split into two paragraphs.

**Demonstration**:

```
This text is a paragraph.
This won't be another paragraph, it will join the line above it.

This will be another paragraph, as it has a blank line above it.
```

**Output:**

This text is a paragraph. This won't be another paragraph, it will join the line above it.

This will be another paragraph, as it has a blank line above it.

### Force line breaks

To force a line break, **end a line with two or more whitespaces**, and then type return.

```
This is the first line.··
Second line
```

**Output:**

This is the first line.  
Second line

### Horizontal lines

Can be inserted with four `*`, `-` or `_`

```
----

****

____
```

**Output:**

----

****

____




## Links


### Basic links

```
[Semantic description](https://roneo.org/markdown)  
<address@example.com>  
<https://roneo.org/markdown> works too. Must be used for explicit links.
```

**Output:**

[Semantic description](https://roneo.org/markdown)  
<address@example.com>  
<https://roneo.org/markdown> works too. Must be used for explicit links.


### Links using text reference

```
[I'm a link][Reference text]

[This link] will do the same as well. It works as the identifier itself.


[reference text]: https://jamstack.club
[this link]: https://roneo.org/markdown
```

**Output:**

[I'm a link][Reference text]

[This link] will do the same as well. It works as the identifier itself.


[reference text]: https://jamstack.club
[this link]: https://roneo.org/markdown

**Note:** The reference text is *not* case sensitive


### Link with a title on hover

```
[Random text][random-identifier].
Hover the mouse over it to see the title.

Several syntaxes are accepted:
[One](https://eff.org "First site")
[Two](https://example.com 'Second site')
[Three](https://example.com (Third site))

[random-identifier]: https://roneo.org/markdown "This example has a title"
```

**Output:**

[Random text][random-identifier]. Hover the mouse over it to see the title.

Several syntaxes are accepted:
[One](https://eff.org "First site")
[Two](https://jamstack.club 'Second site')
[Three](https://debian.org (Third site))

[random-identifier]: https://roneo.org/markdown "This example has a title"


### Links with Markdown style

To ***emphasize*** links, add asterisks before and after the brackets and parentheses.

    I love supporting the **[EFF](https://eff.org)**.  
    This is the *[Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org)*.

To denote links as `code`, add backticks *inside* the brackets:

    See the section on [`code`](#code).

**Output:**

I love supporting the **[EFF](https://eff.org)**.  
This is the *[Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org)*.  
See the section on [`code`](#code).


### Attribute a custom anchor to a heading

Anchors are automatically generated based on the heading's content. You can customize the anchor this way:

    ### Heading {#custom-id}

**Output:**

#### Heading {#custom-id}



## Code formatting


### Inline

Wrap with single backticks to highlight as`` `code` `` → `code`

### Codeblocks

Create a code block with three backticks `` ``` `` before and after your block of code.

**Output:**


```
sudo apt hello
cat /etc/apt/sources.list
```

Also possible with a tabulation or four empty spaces at the beginning of the lines:

**Tabulation**

	sudo apt hello
	echo "hi"

**Four whitespaces**

    sudo apt hello

Let's test the wrapping of a long line:

	apt install test apt install test apt install test apt install test apt install test apt install test apt install test apt install test apt install test apt install test apt install test apt install test apt install test apt install test

### Codeblocks with syntax highlighting

Set the language right after the first backticks (for example `` ```html  ``) to get syntax highlighting

#### Samples:


#### HTML

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="fr" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/WebPage">
  <head>
  <meta charset="utf-8" />
  <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0">
```

#### CSS

```css
/* Comment */
.blog-post h2, h3 {
  margin-top: 1.6em;
  margin-bottom: 0.8em;
}
```

#### Bash

```bash
# Comment

if [[ ! $system =~ Linux|MacOS|BSD ]]; then
	echo "This version of bashtop does not support $system platform."

sudo apt install test
```

#### Diff

```diff
- delete
+ add
! test
# comment
```

### Escaping with backslashes

Any ASCII punctuation character may be escaped using a single backslash.

Example:

    \*this is not italic*

**Output:**

\*this is not italic*

Markdown provides backslash escapes for the following characters:

    \   backslash
    `   backtick
    *   asterisk
    _   underscore
    {}  curly braces
    []  square brackets
    ()  parentheses
    #   hash mark
	+	plus sign
	-	minus sign (hyphen)
    .   dot
    !   exclamation mark


## Images

### Basic syntax

``` markdown
  ![Semantic description of the image](https://roneo.org/img/ok.png)
```

![Semantic description of the image](https://roneo.org/img/ok.png)

**Note: The text inside the square brackets is important!**

Screen reader users get informations about the image with this attribute called `ALT`, for _alternative text_.

Including **descriptive** alt text [helps maintain accessibility](https://webaim.org/techniques/alttext/) for every visitor and should always be included with an image. When you add alt text be sure to describe the content and function of the picture.  
In addition to the accessibility benefits, `ALT` is useful for SEO. It's also displayed when, for some reason, the picture is not loaded by the browser.


### Image with title and caption

```
![Semantic description](https://roneo.org/img/ok.png "Your title")*Your caption*
```

![Semantic description](https://roneo.org/img/ok.png "Your title")*Your caption*


### Clickable images

For clickable images, simply wrap the image markup into a [link markup](#links):

```
[![Semantic description](https://roneo.org/img/ok.png "Your title")](http://jamstack.club)
```

**Output:**

[![Semantic description](https://roneo.org/img/ok.png "Your title")](http://jamstack.club)



### Image with an identifier

You can call the image with an identifier as we do for [links](#links)

```
![Semantic desc.][image identifier]

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit [...]

[image identifier]: https://roneo.org/img/ok.png "Title"
```

![Semantic desc.][image identifier]

[image identifier]: https://roneo.org/img/ok.png "Title"


## Task lists

```
- [X] Write the press release
- [ ] Update the website
```

**Output:**

- [x] Write the press release
- [ ] Update the website



## Tables


```
| Syntax    | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| Header    | Title       |
| Paragraph | Text        |
```

or

```
| Syntax | Description |
| - | --- |
| Header | Title |
| Paragraph | Text|
```

will render the same way:

| Syntax | Description |
| - | --- |
| Header | Title |
| Paragraph | Text|


### Text alignment in tables


```
| Syntax    | Description |   Test Text |
| :-------- | :---------: | ----------: |
| Header    |    Title    | Here's this |
| Paragraph |    Text     |    And more |
```

See the way the text is aligned, depending on the position of `':'`

| Syntax    | Description |   Test Text |
| :-------- | :---------: | ----------: |
| Header    |    Title    | Here's this |
| Paragraph |    Text     |    And more |



## Footnotes

```
Here's a sentence with a footnote[^1].
(see the result at the bottom of the page)

[^1]: This is the first footnote.
```

**Output:**

Here's a sentence with a footnote[^1].  
(see the result at the bottom of the page)

[^1]: This is the first footnote.

3. wrap sausages - take care not to break the bacon
4. place seam side down on a baking tray
5. sprinkle on bbq seasoning and optional sugar - don't spill, sugar on the tray will burn
6. cook at 170c for 20 mins
7. remove from baking tray and place in serving dish, possibly a disposable aluminum tray
8. bake one last time for 5-10 mins at 190c
9. insert toothpicks last so they don't burn in the oven
10. serve with mustard dip?

# tiktok baked feta pasta

https://liemessa.fi/2020/09/baked-feta-pasta-original-recipe/
https://iamafoodblog.com/tiktok-baked-feta-pasta/
https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/a35421563/baked-feta-pasta-tiktok/

Ingredients

* 1/3 cup olive oil, the good stuff
* 500g cherry tomatoes, halved
* 200g-227g feta cheese (1 block)
* 2-4 cloves garlic, squashed flat or cut in half lengthwise
* (optional) 1-2 shallots, quartered
* (optional) ~~chili flakes~~ maybe use paprika instead
* (?) maybe throw in some herbs
* salt and pepper
* 450g pasta - fusilli or farfalle look good
* salt
* fresh basil, chopped, to finish
* (?) saw someone add honey too, but that probably doesn't go?

Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 400°F / 200°C.
2. In a large baking dish, toss the tomatoes, crushed garlic, and quartered shallots with the olive oil.
3. Place the feta in the middle, turning it to coat it in oil.
4. Season everything with salt and pepper and bake for 15-30 minutes.
5. After 30 minutes, turn the heat up to 450°F / 230°C and roast until the feta is golden brown 10-15 minutes.
6. While the feta is baking, cook the pasta according to the package directions.
7. Save 1-2 cups of the pasta water, then drain well.
8. When the feta and tomatoes are done, remove from the oven.
9. Immediately add crushed red pepper, if using.
10. Stir everything together until the tomatoes and feta combine into a creamy sauce.
11. Stir in the drained pasta until well coated and creamy, adding in a bit of pasta water to loosen if too thick.
12. Taste and season with salt and pepper.
13. Stir in some chopped basil and finish with crushed red pepper. Enjoy!

Notes

* cherry tomatoes – the sweeter the better! There are so many types of mini tomatoes these days, from strawberry to
  grape to on the vine to heirloom. I used one package of classic cherry tomatoes and one package of cherry tomatoes on
  the vine.
* feta – you'll want to get a nice higher quality Greek feta since it's the main flavor of the dish. Grab a block of
  feta, the kind that comes in a brine, not the crumbles. If you want a milder, creamier feta, try French feta, it's
  less tart than Greek.
* olive oil – most of the recipes I've seen call from anywhere from 1/4 to 1/2 cup of olive oil. I went with 1/3 cup,
  you want enough to coat the tomatoes and feta while having a bit of oil pool at the bottom of your baking dish so the
  tomatoes are essentially doing a tomato confit type thing. Too little olive oil and your tomatoes will end up drying
  out.
* pasta – you can use any shape you like, we went with casarecce the first time and rotini the second time and both were
  great.
* garlic – a couple cloves of minced garlic are mixed in and the residual heat of the tomatoes mellows the sharpness out
  while still giving you a huge hit of garlicky goodness.
* basil – fresh basil and tomatoes are perfect pairing. Slice some up to stir in and keep some extra leaves whole to
  garnish with!

# Cheese Crackers

https://foodwishes.blogspot.com/2013/10/cheesy-crackers-simple-joy-of-homemade.html
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxOTPTMyiHU
https://joythebaker.com/2012/10/sharp-cheddar-cheese-crackers/

see also: https://www.fifteenspatulas.com/puffed-cheddar-cheese-twists/ (which uses egg white instead of water)
see also: https://preppykitchen.com/shortbread-cookies-recipe/

makes about 30-35 crackers, or 6-8 shortbread brick cookies 

* 2 tablespoons room temperature unsalted butter
* 3 ounces【85 g】 sharp cheddar cheese, grated (about 3/4 cup【177 mL】 lightly packed)
* 1 ounce【28 g】 Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, finely grated (about 1/3 cup【79 mL】 lightly packed)
* 1/2 tsp paprika
* pinch of cayenne (skipped)
* 1/4 teaspoon salt
* 1/2 cup【118 mL】 all-purpose flour (2.25 oz【64 g】 by weight)
* 1 tablespoon cold water

1. Cream together the butter, cheese, spices, and salt. Use a fork.
2. Add flour and keep mixing to form sand.
3. Add just enough cold water to make it come together. Possibly no water will be needed.
4. Optionally chill in the fridge or freezer to make it easier to roll out
5. Flour a work surface and the dough itself, which is hopefully already in the shape of a disk.
6. Roll out the dough, then cut into shapes.
7. Dock the dough (make dots with a fork or something) to allow some steam to escape.
8. Bake at 180C for 10-15 minutes.
9. Allow to cool slightly before picking them up.
10. Store in an airtight container.

Notes:

* maybe a bit of sugar would be nice
* can substitute with 4oz of almost any cheese
* a tiny bit more butter might help, but then expect not to need any water
* if you make brick shapes (like shortbread cookies) then maybe freeze before baking to keep the shape

# Chocolate Royal (aka "Royal au Chocolat", "Versaillais", "Trianon")

https://www.bakinglikeachef.com/royal-chocolate-cake-by-christophe-felder/
see also: https://www.tartedor.nl/chocolate-royal/

**Ingredients:**

For the dacquoise:

* 3 ½ tablespoons (55g) egg whites (about 1.5 eggs worth of white, if each egg is 60g)
* 2 ½ tablespoons (35g) granulated sugar
* ½ cup + 1 teaspoon (65g) powdered/icing sugar
* ⅓ cup (30g) almond flour
* 2 tablespoons (15g) hazelnut flour

For the crunchy praline feuilletine:

* 1.7 oz (50g) crêpes dentelles Gavottes
* 1.7 oz (50g) milk chocolate
* 1.7 oz (50g) hazelnut spread Nutella
* 1.7 oz (50g) hazelnut praline paste

For the chocolate mousse:

* 2 cup + 3 tablespoons (500ml) whipping cream
* 5 tablespoons (75ml) whole milk
* 7 oz (200g) dark chocolate

For the cocoa mirror glaze:

* ⅔ cup + 4 ½ tablespoons (210g) granulated sugar
* 5 tablespoons (75ml) water
* 9 ½ tablespoons (70g) unsweetened cocoa powder
* ½ cup + 2 tablespoons (145ml) whipping cream
* 3 ⅓ gelatin sheets (or 8g powdered gelatin bloomed in ¼ cup (60ml) cold water)

**Instructions:**

To make the dacquoise (almond biscuit similar to a coarse macaron):

1. Preheat the oven to 335°F / 170°C.
2. Sift powdered (icing) sugar, almond flour, and hazelnut flour through a flour sifter.
3. In a separate bowl, whisk egg whites and gradually add granulated sugar until stiff peaks.
4. Once the meringue is ready, add icing sugar/flour mixture and gently fold in with a spatula.
5. Transfer the preparation in a pastry bag, fitted with an Ateco plain pastry tip 809.
6. Adjust a mousse cake mold to 7 inches/18 cm in diameter, and line it with parchment paper.
7. Pipe a large flat disc inside the mold using a spiral pattern, or simply use a spoon to flatten it out.
8. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes.
9. Let it cool in a frame.

To make the crunchy praline feuilletine:

1. Crush crepes Gavottes roughly with your hands or a rolling pin.
2. Melt milk chocolate in a bain-marie/water bath.
3. Mix hazelnut praline, Nutella, and broken crepes in a bowl.
4. Add melted chocolate and mix again.
5. Loosen the dacquoise from the mold, but keep it inside.
6. Pour the crunchy mixture over dacquoise, spread it in a thin layer.
7. Then remove the mold and freeze the dacquoise for about 10 to 15 minutes.

To make the chocolate mousse:

1. Whip the cold whipping cream in a bowl to get the whipped cream and refrigerate.
   (Note: philips blender with a whipping attachment can only reliably whip 1 cup at a time, so whip in 2 batches)
2. Melt dark chocolate broken into small pieces in a bain-marie/water bath.
3. Bring milk to a boil, pour it over the melted chocolate, and mix with a rubber spatula until smooth.
4. When the chocolate mixture is lukewarm, add it to the whipped cream and mix with a spatula as fast as possible.
5. Transfer the mousse to a pastry bag with a plain tip.

To assemble the cake:

1. Seal one side of the 8 inches/20 cm cake ring with a plastic film and place it on a wooden board or a baking sheet.
2. Insert an acetate collar inside the ring.
3. Poach the chocolate mousse in the mold, trying to raise it on the sides of the ring using a rubber spatula.
4. Take the dacquoise disk from the freezer, turn it over and place it over the mousse (dacquoise side up).
5. Slightly press the disk and remove the excess mousse with a bent spatula.
6. Cover with a plastic film and freeze for at least 5 hours.

To make the cocoa mirror glaze:

1. Soak gelatin sheets in cold water for 10 minutes.
2. Heat whipping cream over low heat and set aside.
3. Pour water and sugar into a saucepan and bring to a boil.
4. Once the sugar syrup starts boilng actively, pour it over the sifted cocoa powder and gently mix, trying not to
   incorporate air.
5. Add the drained gelatin and mix it with a hand blender.
6. Then pour hot whipping cream and mix again.
7. Pass the mixture through a fine-mesh sieve and mix with a hand blender.
8. Let the glaze cool down to 86°F/30°C.

To glaze the cake:

1. Take the dessert out of the freezer.
2. Place the cake on a wire rack or a plate, which is itself placed on a baking sheet to collect the excess glaze.
3. Remove the plastic film, mold (heat the sides of the ring with a blowtorch), and acetate collar.
4. Pour the glaze over the cake and remove the excess glaze with a bent spatula, passing it over the top once.
5. Transfer the dessert to a cake board using two metal spatulas.
6. Place the cake in the fridge to thaw for 3 to 4 hours.

**Notes:**

* Do not over whisk egg whites while making the dacquoise. They have to be slightly firm to incorporate the nut flour.
* Spread the chocolate mousse well inside the mold, using a rubber spatula to avoid trapping air in the cake.
* Once the cocoa mirror glaze is applied, use a bent metal spatula to remove the excess with a single pass over the top
  of the cake to avoid making marks.
* Store the decorated cake for 2 to 3 days in the fridge.
* Take the dessert out of the fridge about 20 minutes before tasting (the cold temperature alters the taste of
  chocolate).

# Honey Glaze (for roast ham)

> Make sure to cut off the actual ham skin (but leaving behind the fat layer) because that's pretty much inedible.
> After cutting one way, remove the skin in strips before cutting the other way to make the diamond hatch. 

* 1/2 cup honey
* 1/4 cup maple syrup
* 1/4 cup (brown) sugar
* 2 tbsp butter
* 1 tbsp mustard
* 2 pinches cinnamon
* 1 pinch nutmeg
* (optional) splash of white wine

1. Mix and boil everything except the wine until foamy and homogenous
2. Keep boiling until sticky
3. Add a bit of wine to loosen it up, so that it can be painted onto ham
4. Keep in the fridge until ready to paint the ham
5. Defrost out of the fridge for an hour to liquefy
6. Paint on a whole ham or on ham slices

Notes:

* need to figure out how to make the ham skin crispy without overcooking the inside - maybe glaze the ham after it's crispy?

French Onion Soup
By Sara Bonisteel

Time: 1 hour 20 minutes

In 1954, what was then called the Food News Department of The New York Times released a pamphlet simply called “Soups,”
which had 20 recipes for soups “thick and thin, hot and cold,” including those for minestrone, shrimp bisque and this
French onion soup. We've updated the recipe adding sherry and wine to layer in more flavors. The bulk of the time is
spent on caramelizing the onions, a process that always takes longer than it seems it should. But it's worth the wait.

INGREDIENTS
Yield: 4 to 6 servings

* 3 tablespoons unsalted butter
* 3 to 4 large red or yellow onions (about 3 pounds), peeled and thinly sliced
* ¾ teaspoon kosher salt, more to taste
* 2 quarts (8 cups) beef stock
* 1 cup dry white wine
* 1 tablespoon dry sherry
* 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
* ½ teaspoon black pepper, more to taste
* French bread cut into 8 to 12½-inch slices
* 1½ cups grated Gruyère cheese

PREPARATION

1. Melt butter in a heavy Dutch oven over medium heat. Add onions and ½ teaspoon salt, stir and cover, letting onions
   soften for 5 minutes. Remove lid and let onions caramelize until golden brown over medium heat, stirring
   occasionally. Adjust heat if onions are browning too quickly. The caramelization process may take 45 to 60 minutes.

2. Meanwhile, warm broth in a saucepan over low heat.

3. Once onions are caramelized, add wine and sherry to the pot and allow mixture to come to boil. Stir in flour and let
   thicken for a minute or two.

4. Slowly add warm broth, ¼ teaspoon salt and the pepper to the onion mixture and boil uncovered for 10 minutes. Add
   more salt and pepper to taste.

5. Heat the broiler, and arrange individual ovenproof casseroles on a baking sheet. Ladle soup into casseroles, and
   cover top with bread slices. Sprinkle each casserole generously with Gruyère. Broil for a minute or two, watching
   carefully, until cheese melts and browns. Serve immediately.

family favorite.

Perfect pancakes are easier to make than you think. This pancake recipe produces thick, fluffy, and all-around delicious
pancakes with just a few ingredients that are probably already in your kitchen (and it's so much better than the boxed
stuff).

How to Make Pancakes
You'll find a detailed ingredient list and step-by-step instructions in the recipe below, but let's go over the basics:

Pancake Ingredients
You likely already have everything you need to make this pancake recipe. If not, here's what to add to your grocery
list:

* Flour: This homemade pancake recipe starts with all-purpose flour.
* Baking powder: Baking powder, a leavening agent, is the secret to fluffy pancakes.
* Sugar: Just a tablespoon of white sugar is all you'll need for subtly sweet pancakes.
* Salt: A pinch of salt will enhance the overall flavor without making your pancakes taste salty.
* Milk and butter: Milk and butter add moisture and richness to the pancakes.
* Egg: A whole egg lends even more moisture. Plus, it helps bind the pancake batter together.

How to Make Pancakes From Scratch
It's not hard to make homemade pancakes — you just need a good recipe. That's where we come in! You'll find the
step-by-step recipe below, but here's a brief overview of what you can expect:

1. Sift the dry ingredients together.
2. Make a well, then add the wet ingredients. Stir to combine.
3. Scoop the batter onto a hot griddle or pan.
4. Cook for two to three minutes, then flip.
5. Continue cooking until brown on both sides.

When to Flip Pancakes
Your pancake will tell you when it's ready to flip. Wait until bubbles start to form on the top and the edges look dry
and set. This will usually take about two to three minutes on each side.

How to Reheat Pancakes
Store leftover pancakes in an airtight container in the fridge for about a week. Refrain from adding toppings (such as
syrup) until right before you serve them so the pancakes don't get soggy.

Can You Save Pancake Batter?
Don't let leftover pancake batter go to waste! Store the batter in an airtight container in the fridge for up to two
days. If you plan to keep it longer than that, it's best to freeze the batter.

Can You Freeze Pancakes?
Yes, you can freeze pancakes and pancake batter.

· To freeze cooked pancakes: Allow the pancakes to cool completely, then arrange them in a single layer on a baking
sheet (make sure the edges aren't touching). Flash freeze for a few hours or up to overnight. Reheat in an oven set to
350 degrees F【177°C】 until warmed through.
· To freeze pancake batter: Ladle the pancake batter in serving size portions into freezer bags, then wrap the bags in
foil. Freeze flat for up to one month. Thaw in the refrigerator overnight.

Allrecipes Community Tips and Praise
"This recipe is one to hand down to your grandkids," raves ashleyalbertine. "Fluffy and delicious. Haven't bought a box
of pancake mix in months! Just add a bit of vanilla and poof! Magic."

"Perfect," according to Laura W. "Delicious! If you're looking for some thick, hearty pancakes these are the ones to
make! Made them exactly as the recipe states and then added mini-chocolate chips to each cake as they were on the frying
pan (before flipping)."

"I made this recipe exactly as written...the kids were eating them off the plate faster than I could cook them," says
aellis1970. "They are so delicious, they were eaten without syrup."

# Pesto (from Thai basil)

* leaves from 3 bunches of thai basil (about 200g dry)
    * these basil leaves are larger than holy basil, and don't smell like mint
    * also pluck off the tippy tops since those bits have flavor - basically put in everything except the stem
    * each bunch costs about $2 at the thai supermarket at golden mile
        * note: they're moving to aperia mall near lavender in april 2023
* 0.8 cups of extra virgin olive oil (160g)
* 1 tsp salt
* 2 heads / 12-15 cloves raw garlic, peeled (60g)
    * use up to 3 heads garlic
* 1/2 cup pine nuts (100g)
    * or 1/3 cup also okay
* 1/3 cup freshly grated parmegiano (10-20g)
    * if using the pre-packaged powdered parmesan cheese, use 3/4 to 1 cup since its really weak
    * other cheeses are also okay (adjust the amount to taste)
        * hard cheeses usually have a better shelf life (if you're planning to make this ahead of time)
    * note from 2023-02-19:
        * used 1 cup (60g) of grated gran moravia (hard cheese) since that was in the fridge
        * using 2/3 cup (40g) was still too little

1. add oil to blender
2. add basil leaves - about 1/3 of the leaves will fit
3. blend in the leaves
4. add basil leaves and blend repeatedly until all the leaves are in
5. add the salt, garlic, pine nuts, and cheese
6. blend to combine, and keep blending to form a pasty consistency
7. store in an airtight container for up to a couple months
8. smooth the top surface of the pesto flat with a spatula, and cover with olive oil to prevent oxidation
9. it does not need to be cooked before eating - that also weakens the garlic flavor
10. the oil preventing oxidation is not wasted - it tastes pretty good after absorbing the basil flavor

* pinch of cinnamon, optional

1. cut fine or blend
2. cook with sugar
3. drain
4. add cinnamon
5. optional splash of white wine

## mummy's recipe

* mummy's recipe has
    * 1/4 cup water
    * 1/4 cup brown sugar
    * 2 tbsp ketchup
    * 2 tbsp shoyu
    * 1 tsp (coarse) mustard
    * 1 can pineapple rings, blended, including the water
    * 1 tbsp cornstarch, mixed into additional 1/4 cup water

1. mix
2. boil, then simmer with lid for 10 mins

## QUICK & EASY LEG OF HAM

Catherine's short-cut, Dec-2010

* 2kg fully-cooked ham

1. Carefully slice off the rind, leaving the fat on
2. Score the fat in a diamond pattern, without cutting into the meat.
3. Prick each diamond with a toothpick, and pierce with a clove.
4. Brush on honey all around the ham, generously.
5. Place ham in a roasting pan, preferably on a rack.
6. Bake at 160C, about 15 minutes.
7. Brush again with honey and return to oven for 30 minutes till golden brown.

N.B.

* While removing the rind, leave all of the fat on the meat.
* The layer of fat keeps the meat moist.
* Spread the honey/sugar mixture directly on the fat, roasting it to a golden brown –
* i.e. the delicious sugar crust is immediately carved, served with the meat & fat, without the rind.
* Allow each guest to lay aside the fat uneaten on their plate.

### Storage

From Australian Woolworth's mag, Dec-2010

(This really works!)

For leftovers, to store ham on the bone:

1. Wrap it loosely with a clean tea towel (or cotton sheet) which has been rinsed in water and vinegar.  (Be sure to
   wring out excess liquid).
2. Store in the refrigerator with plenty of room as the air must be able to circulate around the ham.
3. Change the tea towel every day.
4. Once opened, do not store ham in its original packaging.
5. Stored properly, the ham will last for up to 2 weeks, without having to freeze it.

2. add chicken stock to help tomatoes to cook
3. also add herbs if desired
4. reduce until dry, but not burned so the sauce doesn't turn brown
5. add some tomato puree or coulis or sauce (not ketchup)
6. cook to reduce
7. boil some pasta, leave it a bit underdone, then reserve the water
8. add pasta to sauce and reduce until a bit too thick
9. keep adding pasta water and reducing until everything looks cooked
10. add cream
11. cheese and salt to taste
12. add a bit more chicken stock if it's too sticky/starchy

# Piperade Sauce

see also: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnZ7XGYNfwA
see also: https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/13/dining/131rrex.html

Ingredients:

* 4 red bell peppers
* 2 tablespoons olive oil
* 1 medium onion, chopped
* 2 cloves garlic, minced
* 1 large or 2 medium tomatoes, diced or blended (or 200-250g halved cherry tomatoes)
* 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
* 1/2 teaspoon dried parsley
* 1/2 teaspoon paprika <- important
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 1/8 teaspoon black pepper

Instructions:

1. Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C).
2. Cut the bell peppers in half lengthwise and remove the seeds and ribs.
3. Brush the cut surfaces of the peppers lightly with 1 tablespoon of the olive oil.
4. Place the peppers cut side down on a foil-lined baking sheet.
5. Roast them in the preheated oven until the skin is blackened and blistering, about 30 minutes.

6. Meanwhile, heat the remaining 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat.
7. Add the onions and cook until they are soft and translucent, about 5 minutes.
8. Add the garlic and cook for an additional minute.
9. Add the tomato, thyme, parsley, salt, paprika, and black pepper to the skillet and stir to combine.
10. Reduce the heat to low and simmer the tomato sauce until it is thick and flavorful, about 10 minutes.

11. Remove the peppers from the oven and let them cool until they are easy to handle.
12. Chop the peppers into thin strips, and add them to the tomato sauce in the skillet.
13. Stir peppers into the tomato sauce and simmer until peppers are tender and the mixture is thick, about 10 minutes.
14. Serve the piperade hot, either as a side dish or over eggs. Enjoy!

Notes:

* An alternative to the tomato, onion, etc. is to use some pomodoro sauce.
* There's sometimes piment d'Espelette, hot paprika, or chili flakes to make the sauce spicy.
* Some recipes call for a blend of different colors of bell pepper.
* One of the fancy recipes calls for peeling off the roasted bell pepper skin and blending it into the tomato sauce.
* Fancy French recipes also call for peeling off the tomato skin and deseeding it.
* Some recipes skip the roasting, and just fry the bell peppers together with the tomatoes.

from Ati

* 380g cleaned deseeded chili
* 100g garlic
* 1 cup oil <- todo: not sure about this amount

3. Fry the chili and garlic until it's dry-ish (i.e. stops bubbling)
4. When the garlic is lightly browned (mixture looks orange), add the salt, chicken powder, and sugar
5. Reduce heat to low (to avoid burning the garlic) and continue cooking to fully dehydrate the chili and garlic 
6. When it's cooked, it'll look like the oil is coming out of the chili

# Baba Ganoush / Baba Ghanoush / Baba Ganouj

https://cookieandkate.com/epic-baba-ganoush-recipe/
https://www.seriouseats.com/the-best-baba-ganoush-recipe
https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1014030-baba-ghanouj
https://www.themediterraneandish.com/baba-ganoush-recipe/

## Ingredients:

* 2 large / 3 medium eggplants (2 pounds = 900 grams)
* 1 tablespoon olive oil
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 2 cloves of garlic, pressed or minced
* 1 tablespoon of lemon juice (use 1 if you're not a fan of sour food)
* 1/4 cup of tahini <- warning: nut allergy
* 1/3 cup of good olive oil
* 2 tablespoons chopped flat-leaf parsley
* 1/4 teaspoon ground cumin
* 1 tablespoon olive oil
* pinch of smoked paprika


## Instructions:

1. Preheat oven to 220°C.
2. Slice eggplants in half and brush the cut sides lightly with olive oil.
3. Place the eggplant skin side up on a baking sheet lined with baking paper.
4. Prick the skin all over to allow steam to escape.
5. Roast it in the oven for 30-40 minutes, until tender and slightly browned.
6. Let the eggplant cool, then scrape out the insides with a spoon into a strainer over a bowl.
7. Mix in the salt, then allow excess water to drain into the bowl. Discard the water and wipe the bowl.
8. In the bowl, mix the eggplant, minced garlic, and lemon juice. Stir until the eggplant breaks down.
9. Fully incorporate the tahini.
10. Slowly drizzle in the olive oil while stirring, until all the olive oil is incorporated.
11. Keep mixing until smooth and well combined.
12. Stir in the parsley and cumin.
13. Adjust seasonings to taste - you may want to add more lemon juice or salt.
14. To serve, swirl in a serving bowl, drizzle over some olive oil, and sprinkle over a pinch of paprika.

### Notes:

* Try roasting garlic with the eggplant. About 3x as much garlic will be needed.
* Parsley can be substituted with celery leaves.
* A couple drops of liquid smoke rounds up the flavor, since we didn't actually bbq the eggplant.
* Smaller eggplants have less irritating seeds, so don't go for a single gigantic 900g eggplant.
* Oil can be replaced with plain low-fat yoghurt, if NYT is to be believed.
  * More likely - add 1/4 cup yoghurt, reduce the oil to 1/4 cup, reduce the lemon juice to 1 tbsp.
* Toasted pine nuts are another possible garnish.
* Lemon juice can be partly substituted with sumac powder?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AAx0uIuoBQ&t=7s
https://www.pastagrammar.com/post/basic-besciamella-sauce

* 1 heaped tbsp (20g) butter
* 2 heaped tbsp (20g) flour
* 1 cup milk
* pinch or two of salt
* pepper
* nutmeg
* (optional) dijon mustard

1. fry equal weights of butter and flour until cooked and blonde, and smells lightly nutty
2. while whisking quickly, slowly pour in the milk
3. bring to a boil, keep stirring to prevent it sticking to the bottom
4. add salt, (white) pepper, nutmeg powder, maybe a touch of mustard
5. cover surface with clingfilm to prevent it from forming a skin

notes:

* too thick? add milk. too thin? boil it down.
* escoffier's recipe involved onion and veal
* alternatively use hot milk and cold roux, but never both hot or both cold
  * e.g. boil a bay leaf and half an onion studded with whole cloves in the milk, then strain out
* add (optional egg yolk and) 1 cup of cheese for a mornay sauce
  * double the cheese to make mac and cheese sauce (and optionally add a little onion to the roux) (and optionally replace nutmeg with cayenne or paprika) (and optionally top with breadcrumbs and parmesan and bake https://youtu.be/EMcN2ZzEXGQ)
* halve the milk and fold in a beaten egg white (with cream of tartar) and bake at 190C to make a souffle

# Japanese-ish Beef Meuniere

* 200g frozen fatty sliced beef meant for yakiniku (about 9 slices)
* 1 tsp pepper
* 1 tbsp plain flour
* 1 tsp shoyu
* 2 tsp mirin
* 2 tsp red wine
* 1-2 tsp butter

Instructions:

1. Season the frozen beef slices with pepper and lightly sprinkle / dust them with flour.
2. Fry the beef over medium heat (either dry or with a pat of butter) until just barely cooked through.
   It only takes 10 seconds to cook each side. Remove the beef from the pan and set it aside in a bowl.
3. Turn off the heat. Add shoyu and mirin to the pan and swish that around a little to help cool the pan.
4. Pour 1-3 teaspoons of wine into the pan and deglaze. Make sure to get the brown bits off the sides too.
5. Stir in the butter until it has melted and the sauce has thickened slightly.
6. Add the beef and its accumulated juices back into the pan and toss gently to mix and coat with the sauce.
   The sauce will thicken slightly and become more gravy-like as it is mixed with the flour coating on the beef.

# Carbonated Fruit

make some fizzy fruit

ingredients:

* dry ice
* wide-mouth polycarbonate bottle (ideally from a reputable brand, e.g. nalgene)
* some fruit (ideally soft-ish fruit) peeled and maybe sliced open
    * peeled and sliced pears
    * strawberries (safe not to peel these)
    * watermelon chunks
    * peeled grapes
    * orange slices

instructions:

1. peel, slice, and chill the fruit in the fridge
2. put fruit in bottle
3. put one marble sized (diameter 1/2 inch ~= 1.5cm) chunk of dry ice in the bottle
4. cap the bottle
5. wait a bit for the dry ice to turn to gas
6. let the gas infuse into the fruit for a bit - half an hour at least, but up to overnight
   (this can be done in the fridge)
7. very slowly uncap the bottle, letting the gas leak out before fully unscrewing the cap

slightly hand-wavy science:

* a marble has a diameter of about 1/2 inches to 1.5cm -> the volume of dry ice is about 1 to 2 ml (~= 1.5 ml)
* dry ice has a density of 1.6g/cm3 -> the mass of dry ice is 1.6 * 1.5 = 2.4g
* the molar mass of carbon dioxide is about 44 -> we have about 0.054 mols total
* that's about 4e-5 to 8e-5 mols of carbon dioxide (~= 6e-5 mols)
* a nalgene bottle has a volume of about 1.5 liters = 1.5e-3 cubic meters

```python
n = 0.054  # moles of carbon dioxide
R = 8.31  # universal gas constant
T = 298  # room temperature (25 C) converted to kelvin
V = 1.5e-3  # bottle volume of 1.5 liters, converted to cubic meters
P = n * R * T / V
# = (0.054 * 8.31 * 298) / 1.5e-3
# = 89149 pascals
# ~= 90 kPa ~= 0.9 atm
```

* since CO2 is negligible in the atmosphere, we can ignore the fancy partial pressure math and just add 1 atmosphere to
  account for the gas already in the bottle, so the final pressure will be 1.9 atm ~= 28 psi
* doubling size of the chunk (or using a much smaller bottle) would at most double the partial pressure of CO2, bringing
  it up to 2.8 atm ~= 41 psi
* based on [this youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNTGCgnBoSo), nalgene bottles seem fairly safe up to
  about 40 psi and it shouldn't be *too dangerous* unless you reach 100 psi
* also i've tested this recipe once and excess pressure tends to leak out the cap since you can only tighten it so much
  if you're doing it by hand
* the fruit should be cold (but not frozen) since that lets the gas dissolve into the fruit more easily - the solubility
  of CO2 in water about doubles when you go from 25 to 5 degrees celsius

Solubility of CO2 in pure water at different temperatures ([source](https://www.fao.org/3/ac183e/AC183E06.htm))

| Temperature (°C) | Solubility (mg/litre) |

| 0                | 1.10                  |
| 5                | 0.91                  |
| 10               | 0.76                  |

# Chantilly Cream

https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/247089/vanilla-chantilly-cream/

* 1 cup cream, cold but not frozen
* 2 tbsp confectioners / icing sugar - the tiny bit of starch in there helps to stabilize the whipped cream
* 1/2 tsp vanilla essence
* (optional) seeds from 1/2 pod vanilla
* if using a metal mixing bowl (or anything with high heat capacity), chill the bowl first

For stabilizing:

https://veenaazmanov.com/stabilize-whipped-cream-5-different-methods/

* 1/2 tsp gelatin powder
* 1 tbsp cold water

1. allow to bloom in cold water to avoid grainy bits
2. microwave for a short while until just transparent, not too long or the gelatin won't gel
3. allow to cool, and skip off any foam
4. after the gelatin has cooled, take the cream out of the fridge and whip as usual, but stop at soft peaks
5. mix 2 tablespoons of whipped cream into the gelatin to temper it
6. whip this mixture into the already whipped cream for a short while until it reaches hard peaks - too long and the
   texture will be weird


Notes:

* the recipe is quite lenient, you can up to double any ingredient (except maybe the water) and it'll still taste okay

# Chocolate Chip Cookies

* refer to [docx](Chocolate Chip Cookies v9.docx) for comments / details
* do not update only this markdown!

## Ingredients & Instructions

* 400g cake (pastry/top) flour
* 400g bread (strong) flour
* 2.5 teaspoons baking powder
* 2 teaspoons baking soda
* 1.5 teaspoons fine salt

1. Sift flours, baking soda, baking powder and salt into a medium bowl.
   Set aside.

* 450g unsalted butter (2 slabs, each 227g)
* 400g white sugar
* 450g light-brown sugar

2. Using a mixer fitted with paddle attachment, cream butter and sugars together until very light, about 5 minutes.
   Use a huge bowl. (Food processor, blender, hand mixer, or a fork or two otherwise.)

* 4 large eggs (60g each)
* 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract

3. (If mixing by hand, switch to a wooden spoon, minimum diameter 1cm (3/8 inch) or the spoon might break.)
   (If butter was browned, wait for it to cool first.)
   Add eggs, one at a time, mixing well after each addition.
   Stir in the vanilla.
   There should be about 2.35 to 2.4 kg of dough.

4. Optional step (more important if skipping the long wait below):
   Let mixture stand 3 minutes, then whisk for 30 seconds.
   Repeat process of resting and whisking two more times until mixture is thick, smooth, and shiny.

5. Reduce speed to low, add (sift in if by hand) dry ingredients and mix until just combined.
   (About 5 to 10 seconds in a mixer / blender)

* Either: 1 kg coverture ~60% baking chocolate, coarsely chopped
* Or: 700g nuts + 500g chocolate

6. (If splitting the batch into nut and no-nut cookies, try to prepare and store them separately for the sake of people
   with nut allergies)
   Drop chocolate (and nut) pieces in and incorporate them without breaking them too much.

7. Wrap dough tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 24-36 hours. Try not to skip this step.

8. When ready to bake, preheat oven to 170°C. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a nonstick baking mat. Set
   aside.
   (Ideally, prepare 2 trays and 3 sheets of parchment paper.)

9. Scoop 50g balls of dough (about a golf ball) onto baking paper, making sure to turn horizontally any chocolate pieces
   that are poking up; it will make for a more attractive cookie.

* Several pinches fancy salt (sea salt is nice, or colored salt, or fleur de sel, or pyramid salt, etc)

10. Sprinkle lightly with the salt.

11. Bake one tray at a time until golden brown but still soft (select “convection” then “oven bake”).
    Cookies will appear to be too soft, but will harden significantly as it cools.
    (the following settings optimized for the Sharp AX-1500V oven, bottom tray only)

| Cookie Weight | Cookie Diameter | Baking Time | Cookies Per Tray | Shape       |
|---------------|-----------------|-------------|------------------|-------------|
| 10 g          | 4.5 cm          | 8.5 mins    | 15 (rectilinear) | [⋮⋮⋮⋮⋮]     |        
| 25 g          | 6.5 cm          | 9 mins      | 9 (rectilinear)  | [⋮⋮⋮]       |       
| 50 g          | 8 cm            | 12 mins     | 5 (2-1-2)        | [ ˙̣ ⋅ ˙̣ ] | 
| 100 g         | 12 cm           | 15 mins     | 4 (zigzag)       | [.˙.˙]      |  

12. Allow to cool for 5-6 minutes. Transfer sheet to a wire rack for another 10 minutes, then slip cookies onto another
    rack to cool a bit more. Cookie will be soft and fragile for the first few minutes out of the oven, so be careful
    not to break it.

13. Repeat with remaining dough, or reserve dough, refrigerated, for baking remaining batches the next day.

14. Store in the fridge, separated with baking paper.
    Optionally toast before serving.

## To-do:

* Maybe try a pinch or two of nutmeg?
* Add notes about equipment to the start of the recipe
* Cookie seems less crispy than it should be, maybe the oven is getting less hot now that it's older?
  Possibly due to thermocouple drift since the oven is pretty old, so maybe try raising the temp back to 180

# "Chocolate Chantilly" by Herve This

* https://junandtonic.com/blog/2017/5/24/chocolate-water-magic
* https://inpraiseofsardines.typepad.com/blogs/2006/02/whipped_chocola.html
* https://www.seriouseats.com/herve-this-chocolate-chantilly-recipe
* https://bluejeanchef.com/recipes/herve-this-chocolate-mousse
* https://food52.com/recipes/16044-herve-this-chocolate-mousse

Ingredients:

* 200g dark chocolate, finely chopped (high in cocoa butter)
* 150g water
* (optional) tiny pinch of fine salt

Method:

1. Place chopped-up chocolate in a big bowl, and prepare an ice bath (with a towel on the bottom to hold it in place).
2. Bring the water to a boil, then pour over the chocolate.
3. Allow to sit for a while to allow chocolate to warm up, then stir until all the chocolate has melted.
4. Place the bowl of chocolate over the ice bath.
5. Whip at high speed until the mixture thickens to the consistency of molasses (about 5 minutes).
6. Continue mixing / whipping at low speed until the chocolate thickens (caused by cooling)
7. Serve immediately at room temperature.
8. Otherwise, keep covered in the fridge (it will eventually solidify).
9. Reheat gently over a bain-marie (to soften it), and whisk before serving.

Notes:

* The chocolate will thicken all of a sudden, so do watch for this and remove from the ice bath as soon as you see this
  happening, lest it'll turn hard and clumpy if left to cool too much. Don't worry if this happens though, just heat the
  bowl over a water bath/bain-marie, stir, and the mousse will come together again!
* If the chocolate mixture doesn't contain enough fat, it won't whip into a foam.
  Melt the mixture again over a bain marie and add more chocolate.
* If the mousse isn't light enough, melt the mixture and add more water.
* If the mixture is over-whipped, it will become grainy. Melt the mixture and restart.

my notes:

* this works well with coffee in place of water, for a kind of mocha mousse

* Heavy-duty, 15-inch wide aluminum foil
* A large, high-sided roasting pan that fits the springform pan(s)

INSTRUCTIONS
Prepare the springform pan so that no water leaks into it while cooking:
Place a large 18-inch by 18-inch square of aluminum foil on a flat surface.
Place the springform pan in the middle of the foil.
Gently fold up the sides of the foil around the pan.
Make sure to do this gently so that you don't create any holes in the foil.
(If there are any holes, water will get into the pan and ruin the crust.)
Press the foil around the edges of the pan.
Place a second large square of foil underneath the pan, and repeat.
Gently crimp the top of the foil sheets around the top edge of the pan.

GRAHAM CRACKER BASE

1. Pulse the graham crackers in a food processor or blender until finely ground.
2. Put in a large bowl, and stir in the sugar and salt.
3. Use your (clean) hands to stir in the melted butter.
4. It should have the consistency of moist sand.
5. Put graham cracker mix in the bottom of the springform pan.
6. Gently press down on the crumbs using your fingers.
7. Push crumbs to about halfway up the inside edges of the pan (need not be precise).
8. Flatten layer at the bottom of the pan.
9. Be careful as you do this, as not to tear the aluminum foil.
10. (optionally) Put pan into fridge/freezer until ready to make the rest of the cake.
11. Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C), with rack in lower third of oven.
12. Place in the oven for 10 minutes. (Prebaking the crust gives it the nice crunch.)
13. Remove from the oven and let cool.

CHEESECAKE BATTER

1. Reduce the oven temperature to 325°F. (160°C)
2. Cut the cream cheese into chunks and place in the bowl of an electric mixer with metal blades
   (Scrape down the bowl every now and then)
3. Mix on medium speed for 4 minutes until smooth, soft and creamy.
4. Add yolks
5. Add all 0.75 cups sugar and the salt, beat for 4 minutes more, until cream cheese looks light.
6. Beat in the vanilla
7. Increase blender speed to max
8. Reduce mixer speed to low
9. Add the sour cream and/or heavy cream, beat until incorporated.
   (Occasionally scrape sides of mixer bowl to avoid unmixed bits.)
10. Whip whites with half a cup of sugar to medium peaks, then fold the cheesecake mix in
11. Place the foil-wrapped springform pan in a large, high-sided roasting pan.
12. Prepare 2 quarts/liters of boiling water.
13. Pour the cream cheese filling into the springform pan, over the graham cracker bottom layer.
14. Smooth the top with a rubber spatula.
15. Pour hot water into roasting pan to about half the height of the springform pan.
16. Place the roasting pan with the springform pan in it, in the oven, on the lower rack.
    (Or put in oven first then pour later, whichever is easier.)
17. Cook at 325°F (160°C) for 1½ hours (1 hour should work).
18. Turn off the heat of the oven.
19. Crack open the oven door up to 1-inch (propped open with a wooden spoon), and let the cake cool in the oven, as the
    oven cools, for at least another hour.
    (If the oven has a cooling fan and exhaust then just leave it closed maybe)
    (This gentle cooling will help prevent the cheesecake surface from cracking, if it hasn't already)
20. Cover the top of the cheesecake with foil, so that it doesn't actually touch the cheesecake.
21. Chill in the refrigerator for a minimum of 4 hours, or preferably overnight.

TOPPING

* Note: this is enough for a VERY thick topping and some extra to spoon over individual pieces of cheesecake, if
  desired.
* If you would like a thinner layer of topping and no extra, reduce the sour cream topping ingredients in half.

1. Place 1/3 cup sour cream in a medium sized bowl, stir/blend in the powdered sugar and vanilla, until smooth
2. Fold into the remaining sour cream
3. Chill until you are ready to serve the cake.

MORE TOPPING

1. Place raspberries/strawberries, sugar, and water in a small saucepan.
2. Use a potato masher to mash the raspberries.
3. Heat on medium, whisking, about 5-10 minutes, until fruit is soft and the sauce begins to thicken.
4. Lastly, stir in grand marnier, if using
5. Remove from heat.
6. Let cool.
7. Serve chilled

TO SERVE

1. Remove the cake from the refrigerator.
2. Remove the foil from the sides of the pan, and place the cake on your cake serving dish.
3. Run the side of a blunt knife between the edge of the cake and the pan.
4. Dorie recommends that you use a hair dryer to heat the sides of the pan to make it easier to remove.
5. Open the springform latch and gently open the pan and lift up the sides.
6. Spread the top with the sour cream mixture.
7. The easiest way to cut cheesecake is to use a long, thin knife that has been run under hot water and lightly wiped.
8. Keep warming the knife as you cut slices of the cake.
9. Serve plain or drizzled with raspberry sauce.
10. Wrapped well, the cake will keep for up to 1 week in the refrigerator or for up to 2 months in the freezer.
    (If frozen, it's best to defrost the still-wrapped cheesecake overnight in the refrigerator.)

NOTES:

* Does supersteam work?
* Is it okay to not immerse the cheesecake in the water bath?

# [Erin's Mile High Cheesecake](http://www.grouprecipes.com/44076/erins-mile-high-cheesecake.html)

* 75 minutes to make
* Serves 16
* From krumkake 12 years ago
* see also: http://www.cookingforengineers.com/recipe/89/Cheesecake-Plain-New-York-Style

With 5 blocks of cream cheese in this bad boy, be sure to use both hands to carry the pan...it is HEAVY!
My daughter, Erin, was actually the one to try this recipe out while she was living at home with us.
Well, okay, she didn't make it for her mom and dad – she made it for a guy she was dating.

He didn't last, but the recipe sure did…it is fantastic!
Despite the weight of the pan, the texture is still light and not overly solid.
The citrus adds just a hint of flavor, and makes this one really good with a fruit topping (but I also love it just
plain).

Ingredients
Graham cracker crust:

* 1 cup​ graham cracker crumbs
* 3 tablespoons butter
* 3 tablespoons sugar

cheesecake filling:

* 2.5 lbs (5x 8-ounce blocks) (1.15kg) cream cheese, softened (I don't recommend reduced or no-fat for this one)
* 1.75 cups​ sugar
* zest of 1 lemon
* zest of 1 orange, or 1/2 teaspoon orange extract
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* 3 tablespoons flour
* 5 eggs + 2 egg yolks
* 0.5 cups​ sour cream

Directions:
For crust:

1. Butter the bottom and sides of a 9-inch springform pan.
2. In a mixing bowl, combine graham crumbs, butter and sugar – mix well.
3. Press crumbs into bottom and halfway up sides of pan and bake at 375F (190C) until golden, about 8 minutes.
4. Set aside to cool while you prepare the cheesecake filling.
5. NOTE: If you haven't invested in a pestle yet, go out and get yourself one...
   pressing crusts into pans/muffin tins is SO MUCH easier with that little tool!

For cheesecake filling:

1. Preheat oven to 500F (260C) degrees.
2. In a large mixing bowl with an electric mixer, combine cream cheese, sugar, zests, and vanilla ;
   beat until light and creamy.
3. Add the flour, then the eggs and the additional yolks, one at a time, mixing well after each addition.
4. Add the sour cream and mix until smooth.
5. Pour mixture into prepared pan and bake for 12 minutes at 500.
   Reduce oven temp to 200F (90C) and bake for 1 hour.
6. DON'T PANIC when you see how brown the top of the cheesecake becomes...
   this is what it SHOULD do.
7. Turn off the oven and open the oven door;
   allow cheesecake to cool in the oven for an hour before transferring the pan to a cooking rack to cool completely
   before refrigerating.
8. It is best if refrigerated overnight or at least 10 hours
9. Serve plain or with a strawberry sauce.

Optional Strawberry Sauce:

* 2 pints​ fresh strawberries, stem removed, fruit chopped into large chunks
* 0.75 cup​ sugar
* 1 cup​ water
* 1 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest
* 1 teaspoon finely grated orange zest
* 2 tablespoons Grand Marnier liqueur

1. In a saucepan, combine strawberries, sugar, water, and zest;
   cook until strawberries are soft and liquid is thickened, about 10 minutes.
2. Stir in the liqueur and cook 1 more minute.
3. Serve chilled or at room temperature

# Jam Biscuits (originally named "Fruity Buns")

[http://allrecipes.co.uk/recipe/35663/fruity-buns.aspx](https://web.archive.org/web/20141018001557/http://allrecipes.co.uk/recipe/35663/fruity-buns.aspx)

Makes 12 biscuits.

Tips:

* Use fresh milk
* Use cold butter to create a flaky texture
* Sift the self-raising flour before adding it to the dough
* Use a fork or pastry cutter to evenly distribute the butter throughout the dough
* Refrigerate the dough for a few minutes before shaping it into balls to make it easier to handle
* Leave plenty of space between the dough balls on the baking tray to allow for expansion as they bake
* Keep an eye on the biscuits as they bake to ensure they don't burn

Ingredients:

* 225g (1.6 cups) [self-raising flour](self-raising-flour.md), sifted
    * 210g flour or cake flour
    * 2 tsp baking powder
    * 1 tsp salt
* 100g fine sugar
* 100g butter, cold and cut into cubes
* 1 medium egg
* 1 tbsp fresh milk or cream
* 50g raspberry jam
* (to try out) 1 tsp vanilla, tiny pinch of cinnamon

Method:

1. Preheat your oven to 200°C (400°F) and line two baking trays with baking paper.
2. Sprinkle flour over the surface of the trays and spread it around by tipping the trays from side to side.
3. Sift the self-raising flour into a blender or mixing bowl.
4. Mix in the sugar.
5. Use a fork, pastry cutter, or blend to cut in the butter, until the mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs.
6. In a small bowl, whisk together the egg and milk.
7. Add the egg mixture to the flour mixture and stir by hand to form a stiff dough. If using a blender, blend in the
   butter first, then pulse in the egg until just combined.
8. Divide the dough into 12 portions and shape each one into a firm ball, each weighing about 40g, and about 3-4cm in
   diameter. (If you make 24x 20g cookies, baking time should decrease to 8 minutes.)
9. Transfer the balls to the prepared baking trays, leaving plenty of space between them.
10. Press each ball to 1.5 cm flat and use a melon scoop or teaspoon to make a depression in the center of each biscuit.
11. Place 1 tsp (or melon scoop) of jam into the depression of each biscuit.
12. Bake the biscuits at 200°C (400°F) for 10 minutes until they are risen and golden brown.
13. Allow the biscuits to cool before serving. Enjoy with fresh whipped cream.

Storage:

* Once the biscuits have cooled completely, you can store them in an airtight container at room temperature. This will
  keep them fresh and prevent them from drying out. If you live in a very humid area, you may want to store the biscuits
  in the refrigerator to help prevent them from getting too soft.
* If you want to store the biscuits for longer than a few days, you can also freeze them. To do this, wrap the biscuits
  tightly in plastic wrap or aluminum foil, and then place them in a resealable freezer bag. When you're ready to eat
  them, thaw the biscuits at room temperature or in the refrigerator, and then enjoy.
* It's important to note that the quality of the biscuits may decline slightly over time, as the texture may become a
  little less tender and the flavor may become less pronounced. However, if stored properly, the biscuits should still
  be tasty for several days or even up to a week.

# Lazy Brownies

one portion makes about 260ml of brownie.
scale up as necessary to fit your pan.
this is how big a pan you need for a 1-inch tall brownie:

| scale | square | round |
|-------|--------|-------|
| 1x    | 4"     | 4.5"  |
| 2x    | 5.5"   | 6"    |
| 3x    | 7"     | 8"    |
| 4x    | 8"     | 9"    |
| 5x    | 9"     | 10"   |
| 6x    | 9.5"   | 11"   |
| 7x    | 10.5"  | 12"   |
| 8x    | 11"    | 12.5" |

turns out it might be better thinner, so maybe use a size up

## ingredients

* 40g butter
* 50g chocolate chips
* (todo: use this to dry it out a little) 2 tbsp cocoa powder
* 50g sugar (reduced from 80g)
* 1/8 tsp (or one pinch) of salt

* 1 egg (55g)
* 50g cake / plain flour
* 40g optional mixins (e.g., more (unmelted) chocolate chips, nuts, etc.)
    * chop choc chips a little finer - too big is hard to eat when cold

## directions

1. microwave the butter and chocolate until just melted, and mix to form a smooth cream
2. preheat oven to 180°C, preset timer for 20 mins
3. mix in the cocoa, sugar, salt, vanilla, and egg(s)
4. fold in the flour
5. fold in the mix-ins
6. bake at 180°C for 20 mins, in a pan lined with baking paper
7. leave on counter and let cool to room temp
8. solidify in fridge once cool (warm things will spoil fridge food)
9. remove from pan once hardened and cut into pieces
10. serve warmed (in a microwave for a few seconds) with ice cream

## optional

* small bit of instant coffee powder
* malt / horlicks powder
* add butter/cream = more gooey
* add flour = more cakey
* seen on tiktok - add a frozen layer of nutella and speculoos in the middle

# TODO: Flaky Pie Crust

https://www.inspiredtaste.net/22662/flaky-pie-crust-recipe/

note: the crust was a bit too thin with half a recipe

another note: it works without any water, but it's a bit more difficult to roll out. roll it out on a large sheet of
clingfilm, then use that to transfer it into the pie dish.

lazy to edit so pasting the whole page here first

* 350 grams all-purpose flour (or pastry flour, or 1 part cake to 2 parts plain)
    * this is used in 2 parts below
* 1 teaspoon kosher salt or use 1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt
* 1 tablespoon sugar, optional
* 250 grams very cold unsalted butter, cut into 1/2-inch【1.27 cm】 cubes (2 sticks)
* 0 to 8 tablespoons ice water (skip)

METHOD WHEN USING FOOD PROCESSOR

1. Add 1 ½ cups【355 mL】 flour, salt, and sugar (optional) to a food processor. Pulse 2 to 3 times until combined. The
   remaining cup of flour will be added later.
    * note: this shouldn't matter much
    * also, blending in an ice cube as soon as it's fully mixed helps speed things up
2. Scatter butter cubes over flour and process until a dough or paste begins to form, about 15 seconds. (There should be
   no uncoated flour).
3. Scrape bowl, redistribute the flour-butter mixture then add remaining 0.5 - 1 cup of flour. Pulse 4 to 5 times
   until flour is evenly distributed. (Dough should look broken up and a little crumbly).
4. Transfer to a medium bowl then sprinkle ice water over mixture — start with 1 tablespoon and add from there. Using a
   rubber spatula, press the dough into itself. The crumbs should begin to form larger clusters. If you pinch some of
   the dough and it holds together, it's ready. If the dough falls apart, add 2 to 4 more tablespoons of water and
   continue to press until dough comes together.
5. Remove dough from bowl and place in a mound on a clean surface. Work the dough just enough to form a ball. Cut the
   ball in half then form each half into discs. Wrap each disc with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour and
   up to 2 days. You can also freeze it for up to 3 months (just thaw it overnight in the fridge before using it).
6. roll out and arrange in a pie tin about 2cm high (the pie is quite flat), then stab with a fork
7. freeze in pie tin after docking with a fork. blind bake at 200c/400f for 20 mins, with baking beans

blind baking:

* stab with fork when the dough is not frozen, otherwise the dough will crack
* line with parchment at the botton
* line with parchment or foil, then pour over sugar, pressing it into the corners
* bake at 200c for 15 mins
* remove parchment and (very hot) sugar
* bake at 200c for 5 more mins
* store sugar (very carefully, it's hot)

# Pumpkin Pie

Makes two 9-inch pies
Source: Canal House - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwomP7Urrr4
Original source: Meta Given's Modern Encyclopedia of Cooking, 1969

see also: https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/the-great-pumpkin-pie-recipe/
see also: meringue pumpkin pie recipe below

Ingredients:

* 3 1/2 cups [fresh cooked](#fresh-cooked-pumpkin-puree) or canned pumpkin (one 29-ounce can will do)
* 4 large eggs, lightly beaten
* 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1 teaspoon ground ginger (dried powder)
* 1 teaspoon ground cloves
* 1 teaspoon ground mace
* 1 1/2 cups granulated sugar
* 3 cups heavy cream or 2 12-ounce cans evaporated milk (or replace up to 1/3 of the cream with milk)
* 2-3 unbaked, 9-inch [pie shells](./pie-crust.md)
* [Whipped cream for topping (optional)](chantilly-cream.md)

Procedures:

1. Optionally, put pumpkin in nonstick saucepan and stir over direct heat for 10 minutes until somewhat dry and slightly
   caramelized, stirring frequently. Remove from heat but keep hot.
2. Adjust oven rack to the middle upper position and preheat the oven to 200°C (400°F)
3. Place pumpkin in a large mixing bowl and whisk in beaten eggs (only after the pumpkin is moderately cool, if it was cooked). 
4. Add the cinnamon, salt, ginger, cloves, and mace and whisk to thoroughly combine.
5. Gradually add the sugar, followed by the heavy cream, whisking until all ingredients are incorporated.
6. Divide the pumpkin filling between the two pie shells. 
7. Draw lines on top with a fork
8. Transfer the pies to the oven and bake for 15 minutes at 200c.
9. Reduce the oven temperature to 160c (350°F) and continue baking until the filling is just set in the center of each
   pie and the crust is deep golden brown, about 40-45 minutes. 
10. Let the pies cool to room temperature before cutting and serving. Top with powdered sugar and whipped cream, if desired.

## ALTERNATIVE: Pumpkin Meringue Pie

Makes one 9-inch pie

For the Pie:

* 2 cups fresh cooked or canned pumpkin (one 15-ounce can will do) (recipe follows)
* 4 egg yolks
* 3/4 cup dark brown sugar
* 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
* 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 1/2 teaspoon ground mace
* 1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
* One 9-inch blind-baked piecrust

For the Meringue:

* 4 egg whites
* Pinch cream of tartar
* 1/2 cup granulated sugar

Procedures:

1. Preheat the oven to 350°F.
2. Place the pumpkin in a large, heatproof mixing bowl and whisk in the egg yolks. Add the brown sugar, cinnamon,
   ginger, salt, mace, and cloves and whisk until well combined.
3. Set the bowl over a pot of simmering water over medium-low heat. Cook the filling, stirring constantly, until it
   deepens in color and thickens, about 10 minutes. Remove the bowl from the heat and scrape the filling into the pie
   shell, smoothing it out with a rubber spatula. Set aside.
4. Put the egg whites and cream of tartar in the bowl of a standing mixer and beat on medium speed until frothy.
   Increase the speed to medium-high. Continue beating, gradually adding the granulated sugar, one tablespoon or so at a
   time. Increase the speed to high and beat until the whites are glossy and stiff and the sugar is completely
   dissolved, 2 to 5 minutes.
5. Cover the pumpkin filling with big spoonfuls of meringue, beginning at the edges and working toward the center of the
   pie. Make sure the meringue covers and attaches itself to the edges of the crust or it will shrink inward as the pie
   bakes.
6. Transfer to the oven and bake until the meringue peaks are golden brown, 10 to 12 minutes. Let the pie cool
   completely on a wire rack before serving.

## Fresh-Cooked Pumpkin Puree
Ingredients:

* 6-pound cheese or Cinderella pumpkin, halved horizontally

Procedures:

1. Preheat the oven to 400°F.
2. Place the pumpkin halves cut-side up on a baking pan and cover tightly with foil. Bake until the flesh is tender when
   pierced with a knife, about 1 hour. Remove from the oven and set aside to let cool.
3. Scoop out and discard the seeds. Scoop out the flesh and let drain in a colander for about 30 minutes.
4. Transfer the flesh to a medium bowl and mash with a fork to smooth out any lumps. The cooked pumpkin can be stored in
   a covered container in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.

    * Julia and Jaques – Cooking at Home
* Yields 4 Servings

## Ingredients

* 1 pound / 500g baby spinach
* 1 tbsp Butter
* 1 tbsp Flour
* 0.25 cups heavy cream / 0.5 cups milk or stock
* Salt and Pepper
* (Optional) pinch of nutmeg, chopped shallot, couple cloves of garlic

## Directions

1. Stem the Spinach: Pull the stems out of the spinach.
2. Wash the leaves in a bowl of water to loosen any dirt.
3. Boil the leaves for a few minutes in a large pot of salted water until spinach is wilted and partially tender.
4. Remove to a large bowl of ice water. This stops the cooking and sets the green color.
5. When it is chilled, remove by big handfuls and squeeze out as much water as you can.
   **This can all be done the day before and kept in the refrigerator**
6. Briefly saute the spinach in a frying pan with 1 tablespoon of butter, to evaporate the moisture.
7. Stir in 1 tablespoon of flour and continue to slow saute for about 2 minutes until flour is cooked.
8. Remove from heat and blend in heavy cream.
9. Bring to simmer again for two minutes or so, blending in drops of more cream if the spinach seems too thick.
10. Season carefully with salt and pepper (a little goes a long way). Blend in a bit more butter if you'd like.
11. (Optional) To make a gratin, stir in half a cup of cream cheese and top with half a cup of gruyere, then bake.

  the [original recipe](https://www.chicagotribune.com/dining/recipes/ct-kfc-recipe-test-20160818-story.html)

## Directions from [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/food/comments/1ww8h1/kfc_clone_recipe_results/):

Blend all spices together including the salt in spice grinder until mixed and powdery. Add to flour and mix by hand with
whisk or in food processor.

Marinate chicken in buttermilk 4 hours to overnight. Remove chicken pieces from buttermilk, place in flour mixture,
press down to ensure even coating. Deep Fry at 350 degrees for 8 minutes.

Note: KFC may not use buttermilk... I use it because it makes the chicken taste good. So yeah.

I will give you what I have, the first quote is a debate from the forum about how the Colonel pressure cooked his
chicken. If you aren't interested in pressure cooking then just ignore it. The corn oil recommendation is good though.

Personally, I make up a large batch of seasoned flour and keep it in an air tight Cambro container. I rarely use a whole
chicken, instead I like to cook up about 12 legs, about 4lbs【1.81 kg】, because it's easier to keep track of cooking
times. For me frying 5 legs at a time takes about 15-17 minutes depending on their size. I also tend to use more vinegar
in the brine because it mimics the taste of buttermilk, something I rarely have on hand when a fried chicken craving
hits.

> "One of the secret methods that Famous Recipe is barred from using is (the) use of two different heat outputs from the

Cut one 3½- 4lb fryer into 9 pieces and brine for 4 hours.

Make sure you have corn oil on hand for frying.

**Brine:**

* 4 cups of water
* 1 tbsp white Vinegar
* 1 tbsp table salt, non iodized
* 1 tbsp Sugar, white
* 1 tbsp MSG
* Cut chicken into 9 pieces, rinse and place into well mixed brine and refrigerate. After 4 hours, remove the chicken
  from brine and rinse in fresh water.
* Add the brined chicken to egg wash.

**Egg Wash:**

* 3/4 cup whole milk
* 1 large egg

Mix well in a pan large enough to hold the chicken. Place chicken into egg wash and mix to coat the pieces. Let sit for
10 minutes on the counter while you prepare your seasoned flour. You are going to need anywhere from 2 - 3 1/2 cups of
seasoned flour depending on the size of your bird. It is best to start off with a smaller amount and add more as you
need it. If you like crumbly chicken breading you can add a bit of milk, (between 1-3 teaspoons) to the flour and mix it
up well. This will make shaggy, crumbly pieces. If you don't use cake flour for your breading this step can cause your
breading to get tough and hard from gluten formation.

If you don't use low protein flour like cake flour or White Lily then the chicken coating will become very gluey, dense
and hard. You also will need low protein flour for the biscuits too. If you can find unbleached pastry flour it is
ideal. The bleaching process allows manufacturers to include substandard parts of the wheat that can cause the breading
to be tough.)

The salt is added after the chicken has been cooked, for each 4lb chicken use about 4ts popcorn salt. Some people find
that too salty so you might want to reduce it some. I use finely ground sea salt.

You need about 2 to 2 1/2 cups of this breading for a 3 1/2 to 4 lb bird plus extra for the milk gravy.

If you have a pressure fryer that is the Colonel's method to fry chicken. If you don't, deep fat frying is also good but
the chicken will be less moist but the crust will be crispy.

**Pan Fry/Oven Method**

Preheat your oven to 400 degrees.

Dip chicken in seasoned flour and shake off the excess. If you want crunchier chicken mix a little milk with the
breading, about an ounce or so, enough to make the flour shaggy. (If you don't use low protein flour this step will
cause your chicken to be gluey and hard.) Press the flour firmly on the egg/milk dipped chicken.

Heat corn or vegetable oil in 11-inch straight-sided sauté pan over medium-high heat to 355 degrees. Carefully place
chicken pieces in pan, skin side down, and cook until golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Carefully flip and continue to cook
chicken until instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest part of chicken registers 160 degrees for breasts and 175
for legs and thighs, 15 to 20 minutes. (Smaller pieces may cook faster than larger pieces. Transfer chicken to wire rack
set in rimmed baking sheet. Sprinkle with salt and keep warm while you fry the next batch.

Alternative Method - Heat corn or vegetable oil in 11-inch straight-sided sauté pan over medium-high heat to 375
degrees. Carefully place chicken pieces in pan, skin side down, and cook until golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Carefully
flip and continue to cook until golden brown on second side, 2 to 4 minutes longer. Transfer chicken to wire rack set in
rimmed baking sheet. Sprinkle with salt, bake chicken until instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest part of
chicken registers 160 degrees for breasts and 175 for legs and thighs, 15 to 20 minutes. (Smaller pieces may cook faster
than larger pieces. Remove pieces from oven as they reach -correct temperature.) Let chicken rest 5 minutes before
serving.

Alternative Method Some people think it is better to add the chicken to the hot oil, brown for one minute then put the
lid on the pan, reduce heat to and continue cooking for 8 minutes, flip and cook 3-5 minutes longer or until the proper
temperature is reached. If you have a lid, this method will produce a moisture chicken, but be careful. With the lid on
condensation will form on the lid, be careful not to splash it all at once into the hot fat. You could start a grease
fire if you aren't careful.

Sometimes when I experiment with this method I will add a bit of baking powder to the flour mixture. Since the
temperature is reduced it can inhibit browning, the baking powder will help counter balance that problem. Do not use too
much or your chicken will be over browned. For 2 cups of seasoned flour add 1/8 to 1/4 tsp of baking powder.

Milk Gravy with Cracklins

* 1 TBSP butter (not margarine!!)
* 1/4 cup seasoned breading flour (if you have any left over from breading your chicken use that)
* 1/2 cup fried chicken cracklings strained from the pressure cooker or frying pan
* 1 cup whole milk - cold
* 1 cup boiling water
* 1/4 cup whole cream - cold

Put the butter, flour and cracklings into a frying pan over low to medium heat. Stir continuously until the ingredients
are fully blended and the raw flour is lightly browned. This takes a few minutes. The roux should not be darker than
peanut butter brown. If you burn it, dump it, clean the pan start again. (If you are a novice gravy maker you might want
to save your cracklins until the end so you won't waste them on a burned batch.)

Gently pour the milk, hot water, and cream, continue stirring until it begins to thicken. Taste the gravy and add extra
salt or pepper if needed. Allow the mixture to come to a light boil, when it is the thickness you want turn off the heat
and serve.

COLONEL SANDERS' "KENTUCKY” BISCUITS

* 1 ½ Cup flour (before sifting)
* 1 ½ Tsp Salt
* 1 Tbs Sugar
* 1 Tbs Baking Powder
* Sift into mixing bowl
* 1 Scant Cup Milk – sweet

Shortening size of large egg. Nest the flour, add most of milk, put in shortening, begin squeezing the shortening and
flour in the milk until thoroughly mixed, add rest of milk if needed and mix. Turn on to floured board, knead until
consistency desired, cut into biscuits. Makes 13 biscuits.

(Use Standard Measuring Cup and Spoon – Level Measurements)

Coleslaw

* ½ cup Miracle Whip (he said other brands turned the mixture grey)
* ½ cup tarragon vinegar (The Col used Heinz but it is hard to find these days)
* ½ cup sugar
* ¼ cup salad oil
* dash salt to taste
* 1 head cabbage, cored and chopped not shredded
* 1-2 carrots, shredded - optional
* 1/4 cup shredded onion - optional

Chop the cabbage, grate the carrots and onion. Add other ingredients, mix well, cover well, let flavors meld over night
in refrigerator. Some people say that carrots and onion were not in the original coleslaw recipe so feel free to leave
them out. Chopped the cabbage, don't shred it.

KFC Whipped Mashed Potatoes

Ingredients:

* 2 pounds Russet potatoes, about 8 medium
* 1/3 to 1/2 cup milk, half and half, heavy cream or whipping cream
* 1/4 cup butter (3 tablespoons)
* 1/8 teaspoon fresh ground black pepper
* 1 tsp of Kosher salt

Preparation:
Peel potatoes and quarter. Place in a medium saucepan; add water and a few teaspoons of salt. Bring to a boil; cover and
cook for 15 to 20 minutes, until tender.* Drain well.

Beat potatoes in saucepan over low heat with electric hand-held mixer on low speed until broken up. Heat milk and butter
together. Pour hot milk and butter over hot potatoes and beat on high speed until fluffy, scraping sides and bottom of
pan occasionally.** Season with salt and pepper. Serves 4 to 6.

Tip if it starts to boil over drop in a couple of ice cubes and turn the flame down a little. You can also prevent
boiling over by adding a tablespoon of oil.

*Also add the milk and butter a little at a time. If it's too runny you can't fix it unless you add in some instant
mashed potatoes (a little trick someone on IRON CHEF could have used when they made a disastrous attempt at whipped
potatoes that even baking didn't fix!)*

COLONEL SANDERS' BEAN SALAD

* 1 No. 2 Can Green Beans (Blue Lake or some good quality)
* 1 No. 2 Can Wax Beans
* 1 No. 2 Can Kidney Beans
* 1 Medium size Green Pepper (sliced and cut up)
* 1 Medium size White Onion (sliced and cut up)
* 1/2 Cup Salad Oil
* 1/2 Cup Cider Vinegar
* 3/4 Cup Sugar
* 1 1/2 Tsp. Salt
* 1/2 Tsp. Black Pepper

Drain all beans well, then rinse the kidney beans well. Now combine all ingredients - Let marinate overnight and they
are better after 3 or 4 days.

# Miso Soup

Ingredients:

* 4-6 cups (1-1.5 liters) dashi (either kombu or bonito is fine)
* 1-2 tbsp mirin or ryorishu (optional)
* 4-6 tbsp miso paste
* 100-200g silken (kinugoshi) tofu, cut into 1/2 inch (~1.5 cm) cubes
* 1-2 tsp dried wakame
* 1 spring onion, sliced thinly

Instructions:

1. In a large pot, bring the dashi to a boil and add the mirin.
2. Stir in the wakame and let it rehydrate.
3. Turn off the heat and allow a few minutes the dashi to cool (to approximately 95°C).
4. Using a ladle, mix 4 tablespoons of miso into the soup to prevent clumping. Taste and add the remaining 2 tablespoons
   as necessary. Do not boil the miso. As an option, you can mix it through a strainer to discard any solid bits for a
   smoother final consistency.
5. Add the sliced spring onions to the pot. Also add the tofu, but do that gently.
6. Using a soup ladle, scoop the soup into individual bowls, taking care not to break the tofu. Serve hot and enjoy!

Notes:

* The amount of miso required depends on the concentration of the dashi and the type and saltiness of the miso. It's
  better to taste and adjust upwards.
* The mirin is totally optional, but helps the flavor profile.

* lots of spinach / fenugreek - about 400g, stems okay
* salt
* lots of paneer - about 150-200g
* ghee
* 10 cloves garlic, 1 cm ginger, 1 medium onion, 200g tomato
* ~~chili,~~ a teaspoon each of powdered cumin, cinnamon, turmeric, cardamom, garam masala, coriander
  * if using whole cardamom, toast/fry and crush it, then remove the skin
* some clove, bay (powder), black pepper
* tablespoon or two of fenugreek leaves, half to one cup cream, maybe yoghurt
* tablespoon of cashew paste for thickening?

1. blanch spinach and fenugreek (mustard leaves) in salty water. Blanching removes the raw, bitter, and metallic flavor
   of spinach. Drain, chop, and set aside.
2. fry the paneer in ghee until golden and slightly firm (i.e. less crumbly), and reserve
3. fry herbs and spices until aromatic
4. add garlic, ginger, onion, and tomato, and fry over low heat (do not brown, or the dish won't be vibrant green)
5. if aiming for the consistency of palak paneer, blend the whole thing until smooth.
6. add paneer, stock, cream, yoghurt, dried fenugreek leaves. You'll get that restaurant-style palak paneer flavor by
   adding dry fenugreek leaves

# La Carbonara

* https://www.tasteatlas.com/carbonara/recipe/luciano-monosilios-carbonara---carbonara-by-romes-carbonara-king
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCSowIQgHPI
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90LalTBSIhE
* similar: https://www.seriouseats.com/pasta-carbonara-sauce-recipe

This recipe is adapted from the recipe card Luciano Monosilio gives in his restaurant Luciano - Cucina Italiana with
each order of carbonara. Still, it is also based on our in-house research. Luciano's carbonara is made with a mixture of
pecorino Romano and Grana Padano, which is added to reduce the overall saltiness of the dish. The sauce is thickened in
a bain-marie, so the eggs are cooked but not scrambled, and the sauce is thick and creamy.

![la-carbonara-luciano-monosilo-card](carbonara-luciano-monosilo-card.png)

INGREDIENTS (serves 4)

* 280g dry spaghettoni, monograno brand
* 4 egg yolks
* 200g guanciale, cured for at least 4 months
* 30g Grana Padano, grated
* 20g Pecorino Romano, grated
* 2g pepper, freshly ground

PREPARATION

1. Guanciale
    1. Cut off the rind and the pepper layer. Discard or store for another use. It should be about 1.5 cm thick.
    2. Slice the guanciale into 1 cm slices, stack them, and cut into 1 x 1.5 x 1.5 cm cuboids.
    3. Add the guanciale to a dry pan (no oil or butter), and sauté over high heat until just browned.
    4. Once it browns (and may be smoking), lower the heat so it cooks inside but does not burn.
    5. Let it braise in its fat until crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.
    6. When the guanciale is done, drain the rendered fat into a separate heatproof bowl.
    7. Allow both the fat and the guanciale cool to room temperature.
2. Pasta
    1. Cook the spaghetti according to package directions minus 2 minutes, just shy of al dente.
    2. Use less salt in the water, maybe just a pinch, as the rest of the recipe is already salty.
    3. Use less water, as the starchy water is important for the sauce.
    4. Sir constantly as it cooks.
3. Sauce
    1. Whisk the egg yolks and cheese in a large metal bowl.
    2. Continue whisking over a bain marie while adding half a cup of pasta water, like making a sabayon.
    3. *Gradually adding hot pasta water may be an alternative to using a bain marie, as it tempers the eggs.*
    4. Slowly pour in the drained fat from the guanciale and continue whisking, as if making hollandaise/bearnaise.
    5. You might not use up all the fat. Don't break the emulsion.
    6. *Possible optimization: use the pasta pot as a bain marie, reducing necessary pots by one.*
4. Putting it all together
    1. Add pasta and swirl to combine with the sauce.
    2. Add guanciale and toss to combine
5. Serving
    1. Twirl in a ladle with a pair of chopsticks, then transfer to a bowl.
    2. Use the ladle to scoop over the guanciale and sauce.
    3. Sprinkle additional pecorino Romano over the top.
    4. Sprinkle each portion of carbonara generously with freshly ground pepper.
    5. Serve immediately, or the sauce will dry out and become sticky.

COOKING TIPS

* How To Avoid Turning Carbonara Sauce Into Scrambled Eggs
    * For the perfect carbonara sauce, temperature control is crucial. Because eggs curdle once the temperature exceeds
      65°C/150°F, most recipes instruct that the pasta be taken off the flame before adding beaten eggs. When making
      carbonara, beaten egg yolks are to be tempered, which means you need to raise the temperature of the yolks
      gradually, and essentially cook them without scrambling them. Tempered eggs are used in various sauces as a
      binding agent or thickener, and even though they might look raw, they are actually perfectly cooked.
* Method
    * A more traditional approach is to combine drained pasta, eggs, and guanciale in a pot where pasta was cooked, then
      stir the ingredients over low heat until pasta gets coated with a creamy sauce, which may need loosening with a
      bit of cooking water. However, it seems that the traditional approach may yield unsatisfactory results, which is
      why it's often recommended to mix the carbonara sauce over a double broiler or even mix it with the hot pasta in a
      large bowl allowing the heat of the pasta to cook it.
* Eggs
    * Although traditionally, carbonara is prepared with egg yolks only, many recipes use whole eggs or a combination of
      eggs and yolks. The number of egg yolks/eggs used is also a matter of debate, as recipes vary from 2 eggs per six
      servings to four yolks/eggs for four servings. Also, to get an extra rich sauce, some recipes call for adding one
      egg for every 4 egg yolks.
* Egg Yolks Or Eggs
    * Although today it's been widely established that carbonara is prepared with egg yolks, there are also claims that
      making carbonara with whole eggs is also traditional.
* How Much Guanciale
    * The amount of guanciale varies from recipe to recipe. Some call for merely 25g (0.9 oz) per serving, while others
      call for anywhere from 50g (1.75 oz) to 100 (3.5 oz) per serving.
* How To Cut The Guanciale
    * Guanciale can be cut either into strips or into dices. Cutting guanciale into strips makes for a crispier,
      crunchier guanciale once browned, especially if it's cut very thin, while cutting guanciale into dices will
      produce guanciale that is crisp on the outside but soft on the inside, meaning the upon biting into one, the fat
      on the inside would explode in one's mouth.
* Browning Guanciale
    * Guanciale is to be sautéed over low heat, and no fats or oils should be added to the pan beforehand. The excess
      rendered fat can be removed, if desired, by soaking it up with a paper towel or by draining the guanciale and
      discarding the fat. If the fat and the guanciale burns, it should not be used but thrown away, and a new batch
      should be fried.
* Guanciale Substitutes
    * If not available, guanciale or cured pork jowl can be substituted with Italian pancetta (unsmoked) or even bacon,
      preferably of higher quality. However, while browning guanciale doesn't really require using extra fat, pancetta
      and bacon are often browned in lard or olive oil, while some recipes opt for butter. In any case, guanciale, or
      its substitutes, should be fried over medium heat, until lightly browned and rendered.
* Cheese
    * Traditionally, the best cheese is Italian pecorino (sheep cheese), preferably the Pecorino Romano variety, but it
      can be partially or entirely substituted with Parmigiano-Reggiano. However, this will make for a much saltier
      carbonara sauce, especially if combined with pancetta or bacon, so take note and cut back on the salt when cooking
      pasta. Also, because Pecorino Romano cheese is a hard-melting cheese, it's crucial that it's grated finely in
      order to advance its melting properties.
* Pasta
    * Spaghetti may be the standard choice of pasta, but other types of pasta like fettuccine, rigatoni, bucatini,
      macherroni, and penne also work well with the carbonara sauce.
* Cooking The Pasta
    * Even though Italians say that the water for cooking pasta should be salty as the Mediterranean when preparing
      spaghetti alla carbonara, this rule should not be followed to a tee, as both guanciale and Pecorino Romano cheese
      provide sufficient saltiness. Also, since starchy water in which the pasta was cooked adds to the creaminess of
      the sauce, halving the amount of water typically used to boil pasta will produce an ultra-starchy leftover liquid,
      which is one of the secrets to a velvety-smooth carbonara sauce. Because pasta will continue to cook with the
      sauce, it should not be completely cooked but be taken out of the water just shy of al dente. Also, when done, it
      should not be well-drained but instead should be taken out of the water with pliers, as residual starch liquid
      improves the creaminess of the sauce.
* Cream
    * Using cream is strictly forbidden and known as the biggest mistake in making spaghetti alla carbonara. The cream
      is heavy and cloying, especially when reduced, and adding it to carbonara turns this delicate pasta sauce into a
      thick sludge. However, some chefs like to add it because it expands the amount of time the carbonara sauce stays
      creamy — carbonara, when made traditionally, turns dry quickly and needs to be served right away, before that
      happens.
* Additional Ingredients
    * In modern iterations of the recipe, garlic is often used, but only to infuse the oil; it is disposed of afterward.
      According to some chefs, a splash of white wine is a welcomed addition, as are onions, while some like to add a
      pop of color in the form of roughly chopped parsley.
* Serving
    * While preparing spaghetti alla carbonara, it is recommended to warm the serving bowls/plates, as this will keep
      the carbonara sauce creamy for longer. Also, carbonara should be served right after it's been prepared, as the
      sauce turns dry very quickly.

## directions, part 2

1. fry the bacon to render the fat
2. add the rest of the meat and fry until no longer raw or wet (if the meat releases water, boil it off)
3. turn off the heat and stir in the chicken liver until everything is coated
4. mix in herbs, tomato sauce from part 1, and a dash of worcestershire
5. if the sauce isn't tomatoey enough, scoot everything over to the side, fry the tomato paste, then mix in

7. deglaze with wine and stir well to combine; repeat these 2 steps until you've added all the wine you want to add
8. add milk and stir, letting it be fully absorbed

## notes

* to do this in one pan: fry the soffrito dry, render bacon, add meat, then tomatoes, garlic, herbs, spices
* for lasagna: omit milk and nutmeg, and consider using more (maybe 2x?) tomatoes
* any color of wine will work, but red gives the final sauce a nicer color

use for:
* pasta bolognese
* lasagna
* chili cheese fries

1. Slice zucchini into 1/8-inch【3.2 mm】rounds.
2. Place sunflower oil in a deep fryer and heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
3. Add some zucchini to the hot oil and deep-fry until lightly browned, 4 to 5 minutes.
4. Transfer to a single layer on paper towels to drain and repeat to cook remaining zucchini.
5. Let zucchini cool to room temperature.
6. Transfer cooled zucchini to a bowl. Cover and refrigerate, 8 hours to overnight.
7. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally,
   until it's 2 minutes away from being tender yet firm to the bite, 9 to 10 minutes.
8. As you are cooking the spaghetti, heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat.
9. Add zucchini and salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until it starts to release juices, soften, and break down,
   3 to 5 minutes. Also add garlic, if using
10. Add a couple splashes of the pasta water to the zucchini, but don't overdo it.
11. Break zucchini into small pieces with the edge of a spoon or spatula.
12. Reduce heat to low and toss in basil and butter; stir until butter melts.
13. Grab spaghetti with tongs and transfer it right into the sauce; stir until coated.
14. Mix in Pecorino Romano and Parmigiano-Reggiano cheeses.
15. Add a final splash of pasta water and adjust salt if needed.
16. Serve with more grated cheese, fresh basil, pepper, and optional butter.

Chef's Notes

* Use any zucchini from your garden; different types and sizes are fine.
* If your deep fryer is small, you can use a Dutch oven instead and fry more zucchini at a time.
* You can add a clove of minced garlic when making the sauce if you want.
* Use grated provolone del Monoco cheese if you can find it. I used 1/2 Parmesan cheese and 1/2 Toma cheese.

* 3-4 cloves garlic, minced
* about half a carrot, julienned (sliced into thin strips)
* half a lettuce, sliced about 1cm thick, the end cuts need to be cut again because they'll be too huge otherwise
* 6 small (dried and rehydrated for 30 mins) mushrooms
* 130g dried bee hoon, soaked for about 20 mins
* 1 can pork trotters, 2 would be better
* about 1 pork trotter can full of water (used to soak mushrooms), which is a good way to wash in the last bits of pork
* 1 tbsp shoyu
* 1 tbsp dark soy sauce
* 1-2 stalks spring onion, sliced thin

1. Pre-soak the bee hoon and mushrooms.
2. Fry the garlic, carrots, and mushrooms in a pan until fragrant.
3. Stir in the lettuce and cook until it has just wilted.
4. Add the pork trotters, water (used to soak mushrooms), shoyu, and dark soy sauce. Stir and bring it to a simmer.
5. Add the soaked bee hoon and cook until it has absorbed most of the sauce.
6. Serve with spring onions on top.

https://howtofeedaloon.com/provencal-chicken-stew/

Basically regular stew with olives and different herbs

* 4 boneless chicken thighs

    * traditionally rosemary, savory/thyme, oregano/marjoram

* mirepoix
    * 1 onion / 4-6 shallots, cubed
    * 1 big carrot, cubed
    * celery

* optional 300g artichoke hearts
* 250g mushrooms (oyster is fine, but not golden needle mushrooms)
* 1 cup pitted whole olives
* finished with a bit of butter
* a few slices of bread

Not provencal:

* excess flour from fried chicken is fried and added into the stew to thicken
* peas, zucchini
* gelatin

* potatoes, small cubes

PREPARATION

# Ramen Eggs (aka "Ajitsuke Tamago" or "Ajitama")

* 7 eggs
* 1/4 cup shoyu
* 1/4 cup mirin
* 1/4 cup sake (optionally less or none, to taste)
* 2 tbsp sugar
* 1/4 - 1/2 cup dashi or water

1. Boil eggs until just about done, about 7 minutes, starting in boiling water
2. Transfer eggs directly into ice bath
3. Peel eggs
4. Mix the marinade
5. Soak eggs in marinade
6. Cover with a paper towel to ensure the top is also wet
7. Keep in fridge for at least 24 hours (and at most 2-3 days, otherwise the marinade will harden the eggs)
8. Slice with a tomato knife or dental floss

Notes:

* Optionally add 1 tbsp of vinegar into the water when boiling the eggs for easier peeling
* Add a teaspoon of dark soy sauce for darker colored eggs

# Roasted / Grilled Rack of Lamb

https://www.themediterraneandish.com/roast-lamb-rack-recipe/

* 3 tbsp dry rosemary
* 1 tbsp oregano
* 1 tbsp thyme
* 1 tsp paprika
* 1 tsp salt (can try up to 1 tbsp, it wasn't salty enough)
* 1 tsp pepper
* 20-30 cloves raw garlic
* about 1/2 cup olive oil
* 1 rack of lamb

1. Blend the spices and 3/4 of the olive oil in the smallest blender vessel possible to minimize the mess. Slowly add
   just enough olive oil until it forms a gluey paste. A full-size blender may be too small to make this portion size.
2. Prepare a rack of lamb, with 8-9 ribs, by:
    * optionally frenching it
    * cutting between the bones from the meat side, leaving them attached via the fat cap layer
    * scoring the fat cap diagonally and not too deeply
    * optionally wrapping foil around the bits of bone sticking out to prevent it from looking blackened after cooking
3. Slather all over the rack, as well as into the cuts and scores, and store in the fridge in a ziploc bag for a few
   hours or days. The pastiness of the garlic should help it stick on fairly well.
4. Preheat the oven to 120C and roast for 25-30 minutes
5. Poke around inside the cut between the bones to see how red it looks
6. Increase the temperature to 160-180C and finish for 5-10 minutes
7. To serve, just slice the fat cap in the appropriate locations. Also have mint sauce and/or jelly, and maybe some
   red wine shallot (or Bordelaise) sauce.

* https://www.koreanbapsang.com/baekkimchi/

## Ingredients

Cabbage:

* 1.5kg napa cabbage cores, quartered and washed
* 2.5 tablespoons salt

Fillings:

* 250g Korean radish (or daikon), peeled and julienned
* 1 carrot, julienned
* 0.75 cup buchu (Asian chives), cut into 1 inch pieces
* 3-4 dried jujubes, seeded and julienned
* 2 fresh chestnuts, peeled and julienned
* 2 tablespoons pine nuts
* Several silgochu (chili skin) strands
* 0.5 red bell pepper, cored, seeded, and julienned
* (optional) green onion or scallions, julienned
* (optional) parsley
* (optional) some apple or pear, julienned

Pickling liquid:

* 1 medium (about 2 cups) pear (or apple), peeled and cored
* 4-8 garlic cloves
* 0.5 cup onion
* 0.5-1 inch ginger
* 1 tablespoon salt mixed in 2-4 cups water to form a brine
* (optional) 1 tbsp fish sauce

## Directions

1. Sprinkle salt evenly between the cabbage leaves, and leave to sit for 1 to 4 hours, turning every 20 minutes
2. Rinse out excess salt
3. Combine fillings in a bowl
4. Blend pear, garlic, onion, and ginger in a food processor until creamy, and pour the mix into a cloth pouch
5. Put the pouch into the bowl of brine, and squeeze to extract the juice
6. Take a cabbage quarter and spread some of the vegetable fillings between each leaf
7. Put it into a container, such as a glass jar, or Korean earthenware pot. Repeat with the remaining cabbage
8. Pour the brine over the kimchi so it’s submerged
9. ~~Cover and let sit at room temperature until it starts fermenting, which should be between 1 to 2 days~~
   (Just keep an eye on the kimchi and taste it now and then: when the brine turns sour, it’s fermenting)
10. Store it to the fridge, which will slow down the fermentation process. It will keep for about 1 month. Serve cold.
