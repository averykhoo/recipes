In a bowl, mix 33g unsalted butter (softened) with 40g sugar until well combined.  Add 40g all-purpose flour and mix until clumps together into one.  Spread the mixture to a thickness of 2-3 mm and freeze for 15 minutes.  Use cups or cookie cutters with a diameter of 5 cm to cut the frozen butter quickly.  Separate and place on a wrap, then freeze until use.  In a pot, melt 60g unsalted butter with 65g milk, 65g water, and 2g salt.  Boil for 10 seconds, then turn off the stove.  Add 65g all-purpose flour quickly, turn on the stove again, and stir-fry constantly for 1 minute.  Spread the dough wide and let it cool for 1 minute.  Add room temperature eggs in 3-4 portions, mixing until the consistency is right (forms a V).  Put the dough in a piping bag with a 1cm diameter round piping tip.  Sprinkle flour on a 5 cm diameter cup, mark where to squeeze the batter, and pipe onto a baking paper.  Add the frozen butter. Bake at 190°C (375°F) for 15 minutes, then at 170°C (338°F) for another 15 minutes.  Open the oven door slightly and take it out after 10 minutes. Let it cool.Custard Cream:  In a bowl, mix 2 egg yolks with 35g sugar until pale yellow.  Add 10g cornstarch and mix well.  In a pot, heat 200g milk and 1 tsp vanilla extract. Add the egg mixture and stir until large bubbles burst.  Spread the hot custard cream on a tray, cover with plastic wrap, and freeze for 15 minutes.  In another bowl, stir 170g heavy cream with 17g sugar until thick.  Mix the thick cream with the custard cream.  Make a hole in the choux pastry with a chopstick and fill it with the cream.  Choux with cream can be eaten right away, but for better flavor, seal and refrigerate for 2-3 hours.  Enjoy your delicious choux pastry with custard cream!  Note: The recipe is based on the provided video transcript and may require adjustments based on personal preferencesand cooking conditions.Notes:  After filling in the cream, the choux gets damp easily.  To keep the crispness the longest, you have no choice but to fill it with cream every time you eat it.  If you open the oven door while baking, the sugar will collapse (Do not open the oven)"

These biscuits will only pop up sky-high if you useheavy cream - they were flat and not fluffy inside when I tried half-and-half or whole milk)How to make it  In a medium bowl, stir together all ingredients just until the dough forms a ball and ingredients are moistened.  Turn the dough out onto a work surface that is dusted with a very small amount of additional flour.  Fold the dough in half and press down with the palms of your hands;knead the dough this way for 5 to 7 times more, adding just enough flour to keep the dough from sticking to yourhands and work surface.  Gently press dough out to about 0.75-inch thickness;cut dough into 3-inch size rounds (use a cookie cutter or a small juice glass).  Spray a baking sheet with cooking spray and place biscuits on it, leaving at least 1-inch between each biscuit.  Bake at 480 degrees (yes, a very hot oven!) for about 10 minutes, until golden brown on bottoms and tops.  You need to watch them closely at the end so you don’t burn the bottoms - they require a hot oven, so don’t try toreduce the heat.  Just keep an eye on them and when the tops are nicely golden brown, the bottoms should be, too.  If you forget to check them and you end up burning the bottoms (and I HAVE done this!!), just cut off the bottoms ofthe biscuits and they will be fine to eat!  Note: For holidays, try using different cookie cutter shapes, like hearts, holly leaf, etc."

Mash the potatoes and moisten the rusk flour in a little water.  Mix all the ingredients into a smooth farce and flavour generously with salt, white pepper and (optional) finecrushedallspice.  Shape the farce into round balls and transfer to a floured chopping board, then fry them quite slowly in plenty ofbutter.This is what you need (cream sauce, serves 4):  100 ml double cream  200 l water or beef stock  soy  salt  white pepper  (1 tbsp white flour)This is how you do it:  Swirl out the pan with a couple of decilitres of boiling water or meat stock.

          "content": "Ikea Swedish Meatballs  First-Time Hack  Active Prep: 20 min  Inactive Prep: 20 min  Difficulty: Medium  Yield: 30 meatballsI know IKEA is a giant global furniture chain, but before researching these great little balls of meat I wasn’t awarethat IKEA is also one of the world’s largest food retailers.At the very top of the list of the most popular menu items at the stores’ cafeteria-style IKEA Restaurant &amp; Bistro arethe Swedish Meatballs, which are consumed at a rate of 150 million each year.The meatballs are moist and delicious and come smothered in a cream sauce and served with a side of lingonberry jam.But if you don’t feel like working your way through the giant rat maze of furniture that is the ingenious layout of eachstore to get to a plate of these meatballs, you can now make them at home with very little effort.The secret is to use ground beef that is 20 percent fat and a food processor to puree all of the ingredients.If you don’t have a food processor, a blender will work to puree the onions, which you can add to the rest of theingredients and mix thoroughly with your hands.I found that a 1 ¼-inch cookie scooper is the best way to form the balls, but you can also form the balls with ateaspoon measure and your hands-keep your hands thoroughly moistened with water to prevent the meat mixture fromsticking to them.MEATBALLS1/3 cup chopped onion1 large egg1 egg white1/3 cup beef broth2 tablespoons water½ pound ground beef(20 percent fat)½ pound ground pork½ cup plain bread crumbs1 teaspoon salt½ teaspoon white pepper1/8 teaspoon allspiceCREAM SAUCE1 ¼ cups beef broth1/3 cup heavy cream4 teaspoons cornstarch1 tablespoon apple juice¼ teaspoon salt1/8 teaspoon garlic powder1/8 teaspoon onion powder1/8 teaspoon white pepper1 bay leaf2 teaspoons vegetable oilON THE SIDE (OPTIONAL)Lingonberry preservesDirections  Combine the onion, egg, egg white, beef broth, and water in a food processor or blender and mix on high speed for 15seconds or until the onion is completely pulverized.If using a blender, pour this mixture into a large bowl and combine it with the ground meats, bread crumbs, andseasoning.Mix thoroughly with your hands.If using a food processor, add the ground meats, bread crumbs, and seasoning to the food processor and mix on highspeed for 30 seconds or until all of the ingredients are combined and the meat has a smooth consistency.  Preheat your oven to 350 degrees F.  Use a 1/3-ounce cookie scooper (or a teaspoon measure) moistened with water to form balls that are about 1 ¼ inchesin diameter.Moisten your fingers with water to make forming the balls easier.Place the balls on a nonstick baking sheet or a baking sheet lined with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat andbake for 20 to 25 minutes or until the meatballs are just lightly browned.Turn the meatballs over halfway through the cooking time.  While the meatballs are baking, make the sauce by whisking all of the ingredients, except the bay leaf, into a smallsaucepan over medium heat.When the mixture begins to bubble, add the bay leaf, then reduce the heat and simmer for 6 to 7 minutes or untilthick.Discard the bay leaf.  Just before you are ready to serve the meatballs, brown them in a saute pan over medium heat with a couple ofteaspoons of vegetable oil.Serve the meatballs with the cream sauce poured over the top along with a small side of lingonberry preserves, ifdesired.  TIDBITS: You can freeze the meatballs after they have baked.To reheat, add 2 teaspoons of oil to a saute pan over medium heat.Cook the meatballs in the pan, stirring often, until browned and hot all the way through."

When well blended, shape into 1” diameter meatballs.  Place about 2 tablespoons butter in a large frying pan; brown the meatballs in the butter, turning to brown allsides.  Cover pan and gently cook over low heat for about 10 minutes, until meat is cooked through.  Remove meatballs from pan and keep warm while you prepare the gravy.  Stir 2 tablespoons of flour into the pan drippings, whisking together well to remove any clumps of flour.  Whisking continually, gradually whisk in heavy cream or half-and-half, and chicken or beef stock(either will give you a nice gravy – whatever you have on hand).  Season the gravy to your taste with some salt, pepper and just a dash of allspice(if needed – the pan drippings will have the flavors from the meatballs, so it all depends on how much you like theallspice flavor!).  Return meatballs to the gravy and simmer very, very gently for 30 minutes(you don’t want to break the cream or half-and-half), stirring often.  Taste gravy again and adjust seasoning, if needed(it probably won’t be needed, as the simmering will incorporate the flavors from the meatballs into the gravy and itshould be fine).  This gravy is generally not a thick gravy, but you can thicken more, if desired, with a mixture of cornstarch andwater.  Serve over egg noodles, rice, mashed potatoes, or just on their own, with lots of bread to sop up the gravy!"

          "content": "BraveTart’s Impossible Pecan Piehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6zRRuBpPnwI don’t know how anything so curdled, coagulated, lumpy, and broken can turn out so delicious, but this pie manages todefy the odds. The result is half pie, half candy bar, and 100% delicious.Yield: one 9-inch pie, 8 to 12 slicesActive time: about 30 minutes  4 large eggs  1 cup, 8 ounces water  3 cups, 21 ounces plain or toasted sugar  1 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, such as Diamond Crystal  1 stick, 4 ounces unsalted butter, cold  1 Tablespoon vanilla extract, Scotch, or bourbon  2 1/2 cups, 10 ounces pecan halves, raw  1 fully baked 9-inch pie crust  Before getting started, place the whole eggs in a small bowl, cover with hot tap water and set aside.  Combine 8 ounces (1 cup) water with the sugar and salt in a 3-quart stainless steel saucier over medium heat. Stirwith a fork until the sugar dissolves and the syrup begins to bubble, about 7 minutes. Fill a ramekin with water,then use it to wet a pastry brush and wipe all around the edges of the pot, wherever you see sugar crystals orsplashes of syrup. Re-wet the brush as needed, “washing” around the sides until totally clean. Be generous! Extrawater will not hurt the pie filling, but sugar crystals will.  Crank the heat to medium-high and clip on a digital thermometer. Cook without stirring until the syrup is honeycolored and 325°, about 12 minutes. Immediately remove from the heat, add the butter all at once, and stir with aheat-resistant spatula until the foam subsides. Cool the syrup to 200°, about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally toensure it cools at an even rate. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 350°.  Whisk the eggs and vanilla (or booze) in a medium bowl until well combined, then fold in the pecans with a flexiblespatula. Pour the hot butterscotch over the eggy-pecans and fold with a spatula until the pecans are well coated inbutterscotch and the eggs are mostly absorbed. The butter will seem to pool out of the mixture, and you may notice afew specks of curdled egg, but that’s a-okay. Really.  Scrape into the prepared crust, and don’t worry about trying to spread it into an even layer. Bake 30 minutes, thencover the outer ring of crust with a pie shield and continue baking until the filling is bubbling hot and all puffedup, about 15 minutes more. When fully baked, the pie will register 210° in the center. Cool at least 2 hours beforeslicing with a chef’s knife; prior to that the filling will be warm and runny.  Wrapped in plastic, leftovers will keep 3 days at room temperature, or a week in the fridge.Troubleshooting:  This recipe depends on an accurate digital thermometer, and when things go wrong you can bet the readings were off.This can happen by misreading an analogue thermometer, failing to fully submerge the probe in the syrup, or simplywhen good thermometers go bad (a sad fact of life). It can also happen with meat thermometers not intended for highheat, or when the batteries start to fade. Check the temperature range of your thermometer to be certain it canregister 335°, then test its accuracy by making sure it reads 212° in a pot of boiling water.Recommended Pie Crust RecipeIngredients  8 ounces【227 g】 low-protein all-purpose flour, such as Gold Medal Blue Label (1 2/3 cups【394 mL】; 225g), plus more fordusting  1/2 ounce【14 g】 sugar (1 tablespoon; 15g)  1 teaspoon (4g) Diamond Crystal kosher salt; for table salt, use half as much by volume or use the same weight  8 ounces【227 g】 unsalted, American-style butter, straight from the fridge (2 sticks; 225g), cold  4 ounces【113 g】 cold tap water (1/2 cup【118 mL】; 115g)Directions  For the Dough:          Whisk flour, sugar, and salt together in a medium bowl.      Cut butter into cubes no smaller than 1/2 inch【1.27 cm】, and toss with flour mixture to break up the pieces.      With your fingertips, smash each cube flat—that’s it! No rubbing or cutting.      Stir in water, then knead dough against sides of the bowl until it comes together in a shaggy ball.      Dough temperature should register between 65 and 70°F (18 and 21°C);if not, refrigerate briefly before rolling and folding (see note).        Make the Layers:          On a generously floured work surface, roll dough into a roughly 10- by 15-inch【38.1 cm】 rectangle.      Fold the 10-inch【25.4 cm】 sides to the center, then close the newly formed packet like a book.      Fold in half once more, bringing the short sides together to create a thick block.      Divide in half with a sharp knife or bench scraper.      Dough temperature should still be somewhere between 65 and 70°F (18 and 21°C);if not, refrigerate briefly before proceeding (see note).        For Single-Crusted Pies:          Using as much flour as needed, roll one piece into a 14-inch【35.56 cm】 circle;this size allows ample room to line pie plate, with enough overhang to form a generous border.      At smaller sizes, dough will fall short, making it difficult to shape edges,and thicker dough will not crisp as intended. Transfer to 9-inch【22.86 cm】 pie plate;dough should be easy to handle, and will not require any special procedures to move.      Dust off excess flour with a pastry brush, using it to nestle dough into corners of pan.      With scissors or kitchen shears, trim edge so that it overhangs by 1 1/4 inches【3.18 cm】.      Fold overhang over itself to create thick border that sits on top edge of pie plate, not below.      Crimp or shape crust as desired. Repeat with remaining dough.      Wrap with plastic and refrigerate at least 2 hours and up to overnight.      Use as directed in your favorite recipe.        For a Double-Crusted Pie:          Using as much flour as needed, roll one piece into a 14-inch【35.56 cm】 circle;this size allows ample room to line pie plate, with enough overhang to form a generous border.      At smaller sizes, dough will fall short, making it difficult to shape edges,and thicker dough will not crisp as intended.      Transfer to 9-inch【22.86 cm】 pie plate;dough should be easy to handle, and will not require any special procedures to move.      Dust off excess flour with a pastry brush, using it to nestle dough into corners of pan.      With scissors or kitchen shears, trim edge so that it overhangs by 1 1/4 inches【3.18 cm】.      For solid top crust, roll remaining dough as before; for lattice-top pie,roll into a 9- by 15-inch【38.1 cm】 rectangle instead.      Transfer to a baking sheet or parchment-lined cutting board.      (The parchment will prevent dough from absorbing any savory odors from the board.)      Wrap both portions in plastic and refrigerate at least 2 hours and up to overnight.      Use as directed in your favorite recipe; after filling pie and sealing crusts together,refrigerate 30 minutes before baking.        For a Blind-Baked Pie:          Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and preheat to 350°F (180°C).      Line pie shell that has been chilled for at least 2 hours (as outlined in Step 3) with a large sheet of aluminumfoil, pressing so it conforms to curves of plate.      (A second sheet of foil may be needed for full coverage.)      Fill to brim with sugar, transfer to a half sheet pan,and bake until fully set and golden around the edges, 60 to 75 minutes.      Fold long sides of foil toward middle, gather short sides,and use both hands to carefully transfer sugar to heat-safe bowl. Let sugar cool to room temperature.      If needed, continue baking crust a few minutes more to brown along the bottom.      Special Equipment  Rolling pin,  9-inch【22.86 cm】 pie pan (preferably tempered glass; see note),  pastry brushNotes  Compared to stoneware or heavy enameled ceramic, tempered-glass pie plates conduct heat quickly and evenly, so thecrust bakes up light and crisp, never greasy or soft.  When room temperature exceeds 74°F (23°C), kitchen equipment and pantry staples will act as a heat source to thebutter, creating a sticky dough. If it’s warm in your kitchen, take these proactive steps to manage your doughtemperature.  See our crash course in mastering pie dough for more tips and troubleshooting.Make-Ahead and Storage  The dough can be made ahead of time and refrigerated for up to 24 hours before use. To store it for longer than that,the dough can be frozen as a block, rolled, or shaped in a pan. If frozen as a block, dough will still need torest/relax for at least 2 hours after rolling and shaping."

Add the cubed eggplant and boil for about 10 minutes, or until the eggplant is very tender.  Drain and let cool to the touch.  Squeeze the excess water out of the eggplant and place it in a large mixing bowl.  Add the cheeses, eggs, garlic, parsley, plenty of black pepper, and a big pinch of salt.  Add about half of the bread crumbs and begin mixing the ingredients by hand.  Continue to add more bread crumbs until the mixture is soft and moldable, but not too wet or sticky.  Check out the video above to see what the texture should look like!  The amount of breadcrumbs needed will vary, so trust your instincts.  Fill a deep pan with about 1 inch (2.5 cm) of vegetable oil and heat over medium/high.  Meanwhile, form the meatball mixture into about 15 polpette.  They should be formed into flattened pucks, about 3 inches (7.5 cm) in diameter and 1 inch (2.5 cm) thick.  Dust the polpette in bread crumbs.  Drop a breadcrumb into the oil to test the temperature.  If it starts to bubble and fry right away, the oil is hot enough.  Working in batches, carefully drop the eggplant polpette into the pan.  Turn them frequently with a couple of forks and fry until browned on both sides—about 4 to 5 minutes in total.  Remove to a paper towel to drain.  Serve the polpette warm and fresh. Buon appetito!"

Add about half of the bread crumbs and mix together with a spoon.  Gradually continue to add more bread crumbs until the mixture becomes soft and moldable, but no longer sticks to yourhands when you roll a piece between your palms.  Roll the mixture into balls, about 2 inches (5 cm) in diameter.  Heat the olive oil and garlic clove in a wide pot over medium heat.  When the garlic starts to sizzle, place the ricotta polpette into the bottom of the pot.  Gently swirl the pot to move the polpette around and coat them with olive oil.  Fill the pot with about ½ inch (1.25 cm) of warm water.  Lower the heat, bring the liquid to a simmer, and cover the pot.  Cook for 20 minutes, occasionally swirling the pot to stir.  If the water evaporates completely, add a little bit more as necessary to keep a simmer going.  Serve warm and fresh, drizzled with the pan juices.  Buon appetito!Notes:  This recipe works best with real ricotta, not the poor substitute you’ll find in a store."

Add mashed bananas, sour cream and vanilla, stirring together well.  Mix in flour, baking soda and salt, stirring until it is well blended.  Pour into 1 greased large loaf pan or 3 small loaf pans (I always use 3 of the 7 3/8 x 3 5/8 inch loaf pans - Ithink it gives the best results).  Sprinkle additional brown sugar generously over top of batter, using your hand to gently pat some of it into thebatter.  Bake at 325 degrees: large loaf pan for about 1 hour, smaller loaves for about 45 minutes.  Allow bread to cool in pans for about 20 minutes, then run a sharp knife around the edges, tap the pan on the counterseveral times to release the bread from the bottom of the pan, then invert pan over a wire rack and let the breadfall onto the rack to finish cooling completely.  Variations and Suggestions: Add any of the following – miniature chocolate chips, toffee bits, shredded coconut,chopped pecans or macadamia nuts.  Try toasting your banana bread – spread hot toasted bread with butter and even add a sprinkling of cinnamon and sugarand some slices of banana, or top with a combination of honey and peanut butter, or spread hot toasted bread withsome Nutella…the possibilities are endless!  Use slices of banana bread to make your French toast.Just dust the finished product with some powdered sugar, or a little powdered sugar glaze, or spread on someNutella, and maple syrup is good on it, too…you’ve gotta try it!"

In a large baking dish, toss the tomatoes, crushed garlic, and quartered shallots with the olive oil.  Place the feta in the middle, turning it to coat it in oil.  Season everything with salt and pepper and bake for 15-30 minutes.  After 30 minutes, turn the heat up to 450°F / 230°C and roast until the feta is golden brown 10-15 minutes.  While the feta is baking, cook the pasta according to the package directions.  Save 1-2 cups of the pasta water, then drain well.  When the feta and tomatoes are done, remove from the oven.  Immediately add crushed red pepper, if using.  Stir everything together until the tomatoes and feta combine into a creamy sauce.  Stir in the drained pasta until well coated and creamy, adding in a bit of pasta water to loosen if too thick.  Taste and season with salt and pepper.  Stir in some chopped basil and finish with crushed red pepper. Enjoy!Notes  cherry tomatoes – the sweeter the better! There are so many types of mini tomatoes these days, from strawberry togrape to on the vine to heirloom. I used one package of classic cherry tomatoes and one package of cherry tomatoes onthe vine.  feta – you’ll want to get a nice higher quality Greek feta since it’s the main flavor of the dish. Grab a block offeta, the kind that comes in a brine, not the crumbles. If you want a milder, creamier feta, try French feta, it’sless tart than Greek.  olive oil – most of the recipes I’ve seen call from anywhere from 1/4 to 1/2 cup of olive oil. I went with 1/3 cup,you want enough to coat the tomatoes and feta while having a bit of oil pool at the bottom of your baking dish so thetomatoes are essentially doing a tomato confit type thing. Too little olive oil and your tomatoes will end up dryingout.  pasta – you can use any shape you like, we went with casarecce the first time and rotini the second time and both weregreat.  garlic – a couple cloves of minced garlic are mixed in and the residual heat of the tomatoes mellows the sharpness outwhile still giving you a huge hit of garlicky goodness.  basil – fresh basil and tomatoes are perfect pairing. Slice some up to stir in and keep some extra leaves whole togarnish with!"

Sift powdered (icing) sugar, almond flour, and hazelnut flour through a flour sifter.  In a separate bowl, whisk egg whites and gradually add granulated sugar until stiff peaks.  Once the meringue is ready, add icing sugar/flour mixture and gently fold in with a spatula.  Transfer the preparation in a pastry bag, fitted with an Ateco plain pastry tip 809.  Adjust a mousse cake mold to 7 inches/18 cm in diameter, and line it with parchment paper.  Pipe a large flat disc inside the mold using a spiral pattern, or simply use a spoon to flatten it out.  Bake for 20 to 25 minutes.  Let it cool in a frame.To make the crunchy praline feuilletine:  Crush crepes Gavottes roughly with your hands or a rolling pin.  Melt milk chocolate in a bain-marie/water bath.  Mix hazelnut praline, Nutella, and broken crepes in a bowl.  Add melted chocolate and mix again.  Loosen the dacquoise from the mold, but keep it inside.  Pour the crunchy mixture over dacquoise, spread it in a thin layer.  Then remove the mold and freeze the dacquoise for about 10 to 15 minutes.To make the chocolate mousse:  Whip the cold whipping cream in a bowl to get the whipped cream and refrigerate.(Note: philips blender with a whipping attachment can only reliably whip 1 cup at a time, so whip in 2 batches)  Melt dark chocolate broken into small pieces in a bain-marie/water bath.  Bring milk to a boil, pour it over the melted chocolate, and mix with a rubber spatula until smooth.  When the chocolate mixture is lukewarm, add it to the whipped cream and mix with a spatula as fast as possible.  Transfer the mousse to a pastry bag with a plain tip.To assemble the cake:  Seal one side of the 8 inches/20 cm cake ring with a plastic film and place it on a wooden board or a baking sheet.  Insert an acetate collar inside the ring.  Poach the chocolate mousse in the mold, trying to raise it on the sides of the ring using a rubber spatula.  Take the dacquoise disk from the freezer, turn it over and place it over the mousse (dacquoise side up).  Slightly press the disk and remove the excess mousse with a bent spatula.  Cover with a plastic film and freeze for at least 5 hours.To make the cocoa mirror glaze:  Soak gelatin sheets in cold water for 10 minutes.  Heat whipping cream over low heat and set aside.  Pour water and sugar into a saucepan and bring to a boil.  Once the sugar syrup starts boilng actively, pour it over the sifted cocoa powder and gently mix, trying not toincorporate air.  Add the drained gelatin and mix it with a hand blender.  Then pour hot whipping cream and mix again.  Pass the mixture through a fine-mesh sieve and mix with a hand blender.  Let the glaze cool down to 86°F/30°C.To glaze the cake:  Take the dessert out of the freezer.  Place the cake on a wire rack or a plate, which is itself placed on a baking sheet to collect the excess glaze.  Remove the plastic film, mold (heat the sides of the ring with a blowtorch), and acetate collar.  Pour the glaze over the cake and remove the excess glaze with a bent spatula, passing it over the top once.  Transfer the dessert to a cake board using two metal spatulas.  Place the cake in the fridge to thaw for 3 to 4 hours.Notes:  Do not over whisk egg whites while making the dacquoise. They have to be slightly firm to incorporate the nut flour.  Spread the chocolate mousse well inside the mold, using a rubber spatula to avoid trapping air in the cake.  Once the cocoa mirror glaze is applied, use a bent metal spatula to remove the excess with a single pass over the topof the cake to avoid making marks.  Store the decorated cake for 2 to 3 days in the fridge.  Take the dessert out of the fridge about 20 minutes before tasting (the cold temperature alters the taste ofchocolate)."

We’ve updated the recipe adding sherry and wine to layer in more flavors. The bulk of the time isspent on caramelizing the onions, a process that always takes longer than it seems it should. But it’s worth the wait.INGREDIENTSYield: 4 to 6 servings  3 tablespoons unsalted butter  3 to 4 large red or yellow onions (about 3 pounds), peeled and thinly sliced  ¾ teaspoon kosher salt, more to taste  2 quarts (8 cups) beef stock  1 cup dry white wine  1 tablespoon dry sherry  1 tablespoon all-purpose flour  ½ teaspoon black pepper, more to taste  French bread cut into 8 to 12½-inch slices  1½ cups grated Gruyère cheesePREPARATION      Melt butter in a heavy Dutch oven over medium heat. Add onions and ½ teaspoon salt, stir and cover, letting onionssoften for 5 minutes. Remove lid and let onions caramelize until golden brown over medium heat, stirringoccasionally. Adjust heat if onions are browning too quickly. The caramelization process may take 45 to 60 minutes.        Meanwhile, warm broth in a saucepan over low heat.        Once onions are caramelized, add wine and sherry to the pot and allow mixture to come to boil. Stir in flour and letthicken for a minute or two.        Slowly add warm broth, ¼ teaspoon salt and the pepper to the onion mixture and boil uncovered for 10 minutes. Addmore salt and pepper to taste.        Heat the broiler, and arrange individual ovenproof casseroles on a baking sheet. Ladle soup into casseroles, andcover top with bread slices. Sprinkle each casserole generously with Gruyère. Broil for a minute or two, watchingcarefully, until cheese melts and browns. Serve immediately.  nyt comments  diane(2 years ago)Simplify by making overnight caramelized onions. Fill slow cooker with 4-5 lbs sliced onions, pour 1/3 cup olive overthe onions &amp; mix well. Cover with lid and cook on HIGH for 7-9 hours. Yes it does indeed needs to be High. I had mydoubts at first, but I’ve done this probably at least 20 times and the onions cook way down &amp; caramelize beautifully. Ihaven’t tried this yet with my new multi-cooker but plan to try that next using slow cooker function.  Elisa(3 years ago)Great and easy recipe. I suggest doubling the onions and mixing in some leeks. Also, since I don’t have oven proofcasseroles, I toasted the bread with the cheese on top (in toaster oven), and served on regular soup bowls.  Gonzalo(2 years ago)1 Tbsp of Sherry is a very small amount, it won’t add any significant flavour. Also, if Sherry boils for a long time, itcompletely loses its aroma. I suggest adding 2 tbsp on each individual soup dish just before broiling (that’s the waypeople have fancy consomme in Madrid)."

Prick each diamond with a toothpick, and pierce with a clove.  Brush on honey all around the ham, generously.  Place ham in a roasting pan, preferably on a rack.  Bake at 160C, about 15 minutes.  Brush again with honey and return to oven for 30 minutes till golden brown.N.B.  While removing the rind, leave all of the fat on the meat.  The layer of fat keeps the meat moist.  Spread the honey/sugar mixture directly on the fat, roasting it to a golden brown –  i.e. the delicious sugar crust is immediately carved, served with the meat &amp; fat, without the rind.  Allow each guest to lay aside the fat uneaten on their plate.StorageFrom Australian Woolworth’s mag, Dec-2010(This really works!)For leftovers, to store ham on the bone:  Wrap it loosely with a clean tea towel (or cotton sheet) which has been rinsed in water and vinegar.  (Be sure towring out excess liquid).  Store in the refrigerator with plenty of room as the air must be able to circulate around the ham.  Change the tea towel every day.  Once opened, do not store ham in its original packaging.  Stored properly, the ham will last for up to 2 weeks, without having to freeze it."

Cut the bell peppers in half lengthwise and remove the seeds and ribs.  Brush the cut surfaces of the peppers lightly with 1 tablespoon of the olive oil.  Place the peppers cut side down on a foil-lined baking sheet.      Roast them in the preheated oven until the skin is blackened and blistering, about 30 minutes.    Meanwhile, heat the remaining 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat.  Add the onions and cook until they are soft and translucent, about 5 minutes.  Add the garlic and cook for an additional minute.  Add the tomato, thyme, parsley, salt, paprika, and black pepper to the skillet and stir to combine.      Reduce the heat to low and simmer the tomato sauce until it is thick and flavorful, about 10 minutes.    Remove the peppers from the oven and let them cool until they are easy to handle.  Chop the peppers into thin strips, and add them to the tomato sauce in the skillet.  Stir peppers into the tomato sauce and simmer until peppers are tender and the mixture is thick, about 10 minutes.  Serve the piperade hot, either as a side dish or over eggs. Enjoy!Notes:  An alternative to the tomato, onion, etc. is to use some pomodoro sauce.  There’s sometimes piment d’Espelette, hot paprika, or chili flakes to make the sauce spicy.  Some recipes call for a blend of different colors of bell pepper.  One of the fancy recipes calls for peeling off the roasted bell pepper skin and blending it into the tomato sauce.  Fancy French recipes also call for peeling off the tomato skin and deseeding it.  Some recipes skip the roasting, and just fry the bell peppers together with the tomatoes."

Slice eggplants in half and brush the cut sides lightly with olive oil.  Place the eggplant skin side up on a baking sheet lined with baking paper.  Prick the skin all over to allow steam to escape.  Roast it in the oven for 30-40 minutes, until tender and slightly browned.  Let the eggplant cool, then scrape out the insides with a spoon into a strainer over a bowl.  Mix in the salt, then allow excess water to drain into the bowl. Discard the water and wipe the bowl.  In the bowl, mix the eggplant, minced garlic, and lemon juice. Stir until the eggplant breaks down.  Fully incorporate the tahini.  Slowly drizzle in the olive oil while stirring, until all the olive oil is incorporated.  Keep mixing until smooth and well combined.  Stir in the parsley and cumin.  Adjust seasonings to taste - you may want to add more lemon juice or salt.  To serve, swirl in a serving bowl, drizzle over some olive oil, and sprinkle over a pinch of paprika.Notes:  Try roasting garlic with the eggplant. About 3x as much garlic will be needed.  Parsley can be substituted with celery leaves.  A couple drops of liquid smoke rounds up the flavor, since we didn’t actually bbq the eggplant.  Smaller eggplants have less irritating seeds, so don’t go for a single gigantic 900g eggplant.  Oil can be replaced with plain low-fat yoghurt, if NYT is to be believed.          More likely - add 1/4 cup yoghurt, reduce the oil to 1/4 cup, reduce the lemon juice to 1 tbsp.        Toasted pine nuts are another possible garnish.  Lemon juice can be partly substituted with sumac powder?"

Remove the beef from the pan and set it aside in a bowl.  Turn off the heat. Add shoyu and mirin to the pan and swish that around a little to help cool the pan.  Pour 1-3 teaspoons of wine into the pan and deglaze. Make sure to get the brown bits off the sides too.  Stir in the butter until it has melted and the sauce has thickened slightly.  Add the beef and its accumulated juices back into the pan and toss gently to mix and coat with the sauce.The sauce will thicken slightly and become more gravy-like as it is mixed with the flour coating on the beef."

Bring the water to a boil, then pour over the chocolate.  Allow to sit for a while to allow chocolate to warm up, then stir until all the chocolate has melted.  Place the bowl of chocolate over the ice bath.  Whip at high speed until the mixture thickens to the consistency of molasses (about 5 minutes).  Continue mixing / whipping at low speed until the chocolate thickens (caused by cooling)  Serve immediately at room temperature.  Otherwise, keep covered in the fridge (it will eventually solidify).  Reheat gently over a bain-marie (to soften it), and whisk before serving.Notes:  The chocolate will thicken all of a sudden, so do watch for this and remove from the ice bath as soon as you see thishappening, lest it’ll turn hard and clumpy if left to cool too much. Don’t worry if this happens though, just heat thebowl over a water bath/bain-marie, stir, and the mousse will come together again!  If the chocolate mixture doesn’t contain enough fat, it won’t whip into a foam.Melt the mixture again over a bain marie and add more chocolate.  If the mousse isn’t light enough, melt the mixture and add more water.  If the mixture is over-whipped, it will become grainy. Melt the mixture and restart.my notes:  this works well with coffee in place of water, for a kind of mocha mousse"

Put in a large bowl, and stir in the sugar and salt.  Use your (clean) hands to stir in the melted butter.  It should have the consistency of moist sand.  Put graham cracker mix in the bottom of the springform pan.  Gently press down on the crumbs using your fingers.  Push crumbs to about halfway up the inside edges of the pan (need not be precise).  Flatten layer at the bottom of the pan.  Be careful as you do this, as not to tear the aluminum foil.  (optionally) Put pan into fridge/freezer until ready to make the rest of the cake.  Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C), with rack in lower third of oven.  Place in the oven for 10 minutes. (Prebaking the crust gives it the nice crunch.)  Remove from the oven and let cool.CHEESECAKE BATTER  Reduce the oven temperature to 325°F. (160°C)  Cut the cream cheese into chunks and place in the bowl of an electric mixer with metal blades(Scrape down the bowl every now and then)  Mix on medium speed for 4 minutes until smooth, soft and creamy.  Add yolks  Add all 0.75 cups sugar and the salt, beat for 4 minutes more, until cream cheese looks light.  Beat in the vanilla  Increase blender speed to max  Reduce mixer speed to low  Add the sour cream and/or heavy cream, beat until incorporated.(Occasionally scrape sides of mixer bowl to avoid unmixed bits.)  Whip whites with half a cup of sugar to medium peaks, then fold the cheesecake mix in  Place the foil-wrapped springform pan in a large, high-sided roasting pan.  Prepare 2 quarts/liters of boiling water.  Pour the cream cheese filling into the springform pan, over the graham cracker bottom layer.  Smooth the top with a rubber spatula.  Pour hot water into roasting pan to about half the height of the springform pan.  Place the roasting pan with the springform pan in it, in the oven, on the lower rack.(Or put in oven first then pour later, whichever is easier.)  Cook at 325°F (160°C) for 1½ hours (1 hour should work).  Turn off the heat of the oven.  Crack open the oven door up to 1-inch (propped open with a wooden spoon), and let the cake cool in the oven, as theoven cools, for at least another hour.(If the oven has a cooling fan and exhaust then just leave it closed maybe)(This gentle cooling will help prevent the cheesecake surface from cracking, if it hasn’t already)  Cover the top of the cheesecake with foil, so that it doesn’t actually touch the cheesecake.  Chill in the refrigerator for a minimum of 4 hours, or preferably overnight.TOPPING  Note: this is enough for a VERY thick topping and some extra to spoon over individual pieces of cheesecake, ifdesired.  If you would like a thinner layer of topping and no extra, reduce the sour cream topping ingredients in half.  Place 1/3 cup sour cream in a medium sized bowl, stir/blend in the powdered sugar and vanilla, until smooth  Fold into the remaining sour cream  Chill until you are ready to serve the cake.MORE TOPPING  Place raspberries/strawberries, sugar, and water in a small saucepan.  Use a potato masher to mash the raspberries.  Heat on medium, whisking, about 5-10 minutes, until fruit is soft and the sauce begins to thicken.  Lastly, stir in grand marnier, if using  Remove from heat.  Let cool.  Serve chilledTO SERVE  Remove the cake from the refrigerator.  Remove the foil from the sides of the pan, and place the cake on your cake serving dish.  Run the side of a blunt knife between the edge of the cake and the pan.  Dorie recommends that you use a hair dryer to heat the sides of the pan to make it easier to remove.  Open the springform latch and gently open the pan and lift up the sides.  Spread the top with the sour cream mixture.  The easiest way to cut cheesecake is to use a long, thin knife that has been run under hot water and lightly wiped.  Keep warming the knife as you cut slices of the cake.  Serve plain or drizzled with raspberry sauce.  Wrapped well, the cake will keep for up to 1 week in the refrigerator or for up to 2 months in the freezer.(If frozen, it’s best to defrost the still-wrapped cheesecake overnight in the refrigerator.)NOTES:  Does supersteam work?  Is it okay to not immerse the cheesecake in the water bath?

In a mixing bowl, combine graham crumbs, butter and sugar – mix well.  Press crumbs into bottom and halfway up sides of pan and bake at 375F (190C) until golden, about 8 minutes.  Set aside to cool while you prepare the cheesecake filling.  NOTE: If you haven’t invested in a pestle yet, go out and get yourself one…pressing crusts into pans/muffin tins is SO MUCH easier with that little tool!For cheesecake filling:  Preheat oven to 500F (260C) degrees.  In a large mixing bowl with an electric mixer, combine cream cheese, sugar, zests, and vanilla ;beat until light and creamy.  Add the flour, then the eggs and the additional yolks, one at a time, mixing well after each addition.  Add the sour cream and mix until smooth.  Pour mixture into prepared pan and bake for 12 minutes at 500.Reduce oven temp to 200F (90C) and bake for 1 hour.  DON’T PANIC when you see how brown the top of the cheesecake becomes…this is what it SHOULD do.  Turn off the oven and open the oven door;allow cheesecake to cool in the oven for an hour before transferring the pan to a cooking rack to cool completelybefore refrigerating.  It is best if refrigerated overnight or at least 10 hours  Serve plain or with a strawberry sauce.Optional Strawberry Sauce:  2 pints​ fresh strawberries, stem removed, fruit chopped into large chunks  0.75 cup​ sugar  1 cup​ water  1 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest  1 teaspoon finely grated orange zest  2 tablespoons Grand Marnier liqueur  In a saucepan, combine strawberries, sugar, water, and zest;cook until strawberries are soft and liquid is thickened, about 10 minutes.

Sprinkle flour over the surface of the trays and spread it around by tipping the trays from side to side.  Sift the self-raising flour into a blender or mixing bowl.  Mix in the sugar.  Use a fork, pastry cutter, or blend to cut in the butter, until the mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs.  In a small bowl, whisk together the egg and milk.  Add the egg mixture to the flour mixture and stir by hand to form a stiff dough. If using a blender, blend in thebutter first, then pulse in the egg until just combined.  Divide the dough into 12 portions and shape each one into a firm ball, each weighing about 40g, and about 3-4cm indiameter. (If you make 24x 20g cookies, baking time should decrease to 8 minutes.)  Transfer the balls to the prepared baking trays, leaving plenty of space between them.  Press each ball to 1.5 cm flat and use a melon scoop or teaspoon to make a depression in the center of each biscuit.  Place 1 tsp (or melon scoop) of jam into the depression of each biscuit.  Bake the biscuits at 200°C (400°F) for 10 minutes until they are risen and golden brown.  Allow the biscuits to cool before serving. Enjoy with fresh whipped cream.Storage:  Once the biscuits have cooled completely, you can store them in an airtight container at room temperature. This willkeep them fresh and prevent them from drying out. If you live in a very humid area, you may want to store the biscuitsin the refrigerator to help prevent them from getting too soft.  If you want to store the biscuits for longer than a few days, you can also freeze them. To do this, wrap the biscuitstightly in plastic wrap or aluminum foil, and then place them in a resealable freezer bag. When you’re ready to eatthem, thaw the biscuits at room temperature or in the refrigerator, and then enjoy.  It’s important to note that the quality of the biscuits may decline slightly over time, as the texture may become alittle less tender and the flavor may become less pronounced. However, if stored properly, the biscuits should stillbe tasty for several days or even up to a week."

Wash the leaves in a bowl of water to loosen any dirt.  Boil the leaves for a few minutes in a large pot of salted water until spinach is wilted and partially tender.  Remove to a large bowl of ice water. This stops the cooking and sets the green color.  When it is chilled, remove by big handfuls and squeeze out as much water as you can.This can all be done the day before and kept in the refrigerator  Briefly saute the spinach in a frying pan with 1 tablespoon of butter, to evaporate the moisture.  Stir in 1 tablespoon of flour and continue to slow saute for about 2 minutes until flour is cooked.  Remove from heat and blend in heavy cream.  Bring to simmer again for two minutes or so, blending in drops of more cream if the spinach seems too thick.  Season carefully with salt and pepper (a little goes a long way). Blend in a bit more butter if you’d like.  (Optional) To make a gratin, stir in half a cup of cream cheese and top with half a cup of gruyere, then bake."

          "content": "https://www.reddit.com/r/food/comments/1ww8h1/comment/cf79qxfI will give you what I have, the first quote is a debate from the forum about how the Colonel pressure cooked hischicken. If you aren’t interested in pressure cooking then just ignore it. The corn oil recommendation is good though.Personally, I make up a large batch of seasoned flour and keep it in an air tight Cambro container. I rarely use a wholechicken, instead I like to cook up about 12 legs, about 4lbs【1.81 kg】, because it’s easier to keep track of cookingtimes. For me frying 5 legs at a time takes about 15-17 minutes depending on their size. I also tend to use more vinegarin the brine because it mimics the taste of buttermilk, something I rarely have on hand when a fried chicken cravinghits.  “One of the secret methods that Famous Recipe is barred from using is (the) use of two different heat outputs from theburners during the actual process of cooking chicken in pressure cookers. Specifically, this means that Famous cannotreduce the flame output while cooking the chicken.” 1968 was still in the era of regular stove-top 16 quart PressureCookers (Automatic cookers didn’t become available until 1972). This quote indicates - as does Colonel Sanders’ 1962Patent - that a part of the official cooking process is that once the pressure cooker lid is sealed and full pressureis achieved, then the gas flame is to be reduced… (And this is so that the ideal cooking temperature of 250 degreesFahrenheit (at 15 pounds per square inch) can be maintain for the duration of the cooking process.)Cut one 3½- 4lb fryer into 9 pieces and brine for 4 hours.Make sure you have corn oil on hand for frying.Brine:  4 cups of water  1 tbsp white Vinegar  1 tbsp table salt, non iodized  1 tbsp Sugar, white  1 tbsp MSG  Cut chicken into 9 pieces, rinse and place into well mixed brine and refrigerate. After 4 hours, remove the chickenfrom brine and rinse in fresh water.  Add the brined chicken to egg wash.Egg Wash:  3/4 cup whole milk  1 large eggMix well in a pan large enough to hold the chicken. Place chicken into egg wash and mix to coat the pieces. Let sit for10 minutes on the counter while you prepare your seasoned flour. You are going to need anywhere from 2 - 3 1/2 cups ofseasoned flour depending on the size of your bird. It is best to start off with a smaller amount and add more as youneed it. If you like crumbly chicken breading you can add a bit of milk, (between 1-3 teaspoons) to the flour and mix itup well. This will make shaggy, crumbly pieces. If you don’t use cake flour for your breading this step can cause yourbreading to get tough and hard from gluten formation.If you don’t use low protein flour like cake flour or White Lily then the chicken coating will become very gluey, denseand hard. You also will need low protein flour for the biscuits too. If you can find unbleached pastry flour it isideal. The bleaching process allows manufacturers to include substandard parts of the wheat that can cause the breadingto be tough.)The salt is added after the chicken has been cooked, for each 4lb chicken use about 4ts popcorn salt. Some people findthat too salty so you might want to reduce it some. I use finely ground sea salt.You need about 2 to 2 1/2 cups of this breading for a 3 1/2 to 4 lb bird plus extra for the milk gravy.If you have a pressure fryer that is the Colonel’s method to fry chicken. If you don’t, deep fat frying is also good butthe chicken will be less moist but the crust will be crispy.Pan Fry/Oven MethodPreheat your oven to 400 degrees.Dip chicken in seasoned flour and shake off the excess. If you want crunchier chicken mix a little milk with thebreading, about an ounce or so, enough to make the flour shaggy. (If you don’t use low protein flour this step willcause your chicken to be gluey and hard.) Press the flour firmly on the egg/milk dipped chicken.Heat corn or vegetable oil in 11-inch straight-sided sauté pan over medium-high heat to 355 degrees. Carefully placechicken pieces in pan, skin side down, and cook until golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Carefully flip and continue to cookchicken until instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest part of chicken registers 160 degrees for breasts and 175for legs and thighs, 15 to 20 minutes. (Smaller pieces may cook faster than larger pieces. Transfer chicken to wire rackset in rimmed baking sheet. Sprinkle with salt and keep warm while you fry the next batch.Alternative Method - Heat corn or vegetable oil in 11-inch straight-sided sauté pan over medium-high heat to 375degrees. Carefully place chicken pieces in pan, skin side down, and cook until golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Carefullyflip and continue to cook until golden brown on second side, 2 to 4 minutes longer. Transfer chicken to wire rack set inrimmed baking sheet. Sprinkle with salt, bake chicken until instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest part ofchicken registers 160 degrees for breasts and 175 for legs and thighs, 15 to 20 minutes. (Smaller pieces may cook fasterthan larger pieces. Remove pieces from oven as they reach -correct temperature.) Let chicken rest 5 minutes beforeserving.Alternative Method Some people think it is better to add the chicken to the hot oil, brown for one minute then put thelid on the pan, reduce heat to and continue cooking for 8 minutes, flip and cook 3-5 minutes longer or until the propertemperature is reached. If you have a lid, this method will produce a moisture chicken, but be careful. With the lid oncondensation will form on the lid, be careful not to splash it all at once into the hot fat. You could start a greasefire if you aren’t careful.Sometimes when I experiment with this method I will add a bit of baking powder to the flour mixture. Since thetemperature is reduced it can inhibit browning, the baking powder will help counter balance that problem. Do not use toomuch or your chicken will be over browned. For 2 cups of seasoned flour add 1/8 to 1/4 tsp of baking powder.Milk Gravy with Cracklins  1 TBSP butter (not margarine!!)  1/4 cup seasoned breading flour (if you have any left over from breading your chicken use that)  1/2 cup fried chicken cracklings strained from the pressure cooker or frying pan  1 cup whole milk - cold  1 cup boiling water  1/4 cup whole cream - coldPut the butter, flour and cracklings into a frying pan over low to medium heat. Stir continuously until the ingredientsare fully blended and the raw flour is lightly browned. This takes a few minutes. The roux should not be darker thanpeanut butter brown. If you burn it, dump it, clean the pan start again. (If you are a novice gravy maker you might wantto save your cracklins until the end so you won’t waste them on a burned batch.)Gently pour the milk, hot water, and cream, continue stirring until it begins to thicken. Taste the gravy and add extrasalt or pepper if needed. Allow the mixture to come to a light boil, when it is the thickness you want turn off the heatand serve.COLONEL SANDERS’ “KENTUCKY” BISCUITS  1 ½ Cup flour (before sifting)  1 ½ Tsp Salt  1 Tbs Sugar  1 Tbs Baking Powder  Sift into mixing bowl  1 Scant Cup Milk – sweetShortening size of large egg.

Still, it is also based on our in-house research. Luciano’s carbonara is made with a mixture ofpecorino Romano and Grana Padano, which is added to reduce the overall saltiness of the dish. The sauce is thickened ina bain-marie, so the eggs are cooked but not scrambled, and the sauce is thick and creamy.INGREDIENTS (serves 4)  280g dry spaghettoni, monograno brand  4 egg yolks  200g guanciale, cured for at least 4 months  30g Grana Padano, grated  20g Pecorino Romano, grated  2g pepper, freshly groundPREPARATION  Guanciale          Cut off the rind and the pepper layer. Discard or store for another use. It should be about 1.5 cm thick.      Slice the guanciale into 1 cm slices, stack them, and cut into 1 x 1.5 x 1.5 cm cuboids.      Add the guanciale to a dry pan (no oil or butter), and sauté over high heat until just browned.      Once it browns (and may be smoking), lower the heat so it cooks inside but does not burn.      Let it braise in its fat until crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.      When the guanciale is done, drain the rendered fat into a separate heatproof bowl.      Allow both the fat and the guanciale cool to room temperature.        Pasta          Cook the spaghetti according to package directions minus 2 minutes, just shy of al dente.      Use less salt in the water, maybe just a pinch, as the rest of the recipe is already salty.      Use less water, as the starchy water is important for the sauce.      Sir constantly as it cooks.        Sauce          Whisk the egg yolks and cheese in a large metal bowl.      Continue whisking over a bain marie while adding half a cup of pasta water, like making a sabayon.      Gradually adding hot pasta water may be an alternative to using a bain marie, as it tempers the eggs.      Slowly pour in the drained fat from the guanciale and continue whisking, as if making hollandaise/bearnaise.      You might not use up all the fat. Don’t break the emulsion.      Possible optimization: use the pasta pot as a bain marie, reducing necessary pots by one.        Putting it all together          Add pasta and swirl to combine with the sauce.      Add guanciale and toss to combine        Serving          Twirl in a ladle with a pair of chopsticks, then transfer to a bowl.      Use the ladle to scoop over the guanciale and sauce.      Sprinkle additional pecorino Romano over the top.      Sprinkle each portion of carbonara generously with freshly ground pepper.      Serve immediately, or the sauce will dry out and become sticky.      COOKING TIPS  How To Avoid Turning Carbonara Sauce Into Scrambled Eggs          For the perfect carbonara sauce, temperature control is crucial. Because eggs curdle once the temperature exceeds65°C/150°F, most recipes instruct that the pasta be taken off the flame before adding beaten eggs. When makingcarbonara, beaten egg yolks are to be tempered, which means you need to raise the temperature of the yolksgradually, and essentially cook them without scrambling them. Tempered eggs are used in various sauces as abinding agent or thickener, and even though they might look raw, they are actually perfectly cooked.        Method          A more traditional approach is to combine drained pasta, eggs, and guanciale in a pot where pasta was cooked, thenstir the ingredients over low heat until pasta gets coated with a creamy sauce, which may need loosening with abit of cooking water. However, it seems that the traditional approach may yield unsatisfactory results, which iswhy it’s often recommended to mix the carbonara sauce over a double broiler or even mix it with the hot pasta in alarge bowl allowing the heat of the pasta to cook it.        Eggs          Although traditionally, carbonara is prepared with egg yolks only, many recipes use whole eggs or a combination ofeggs and yolks. The number of egg yolks/eggs used is also a matter of debate, as recipes vary from 2 eggs per sixservings to four yolks/eggs for four servings. Also, to get an extra rich sauce, some recipes call for adding oneegg for every 4 egg yolks.        Egg Yolks Or Eggs          Although today it’s been widely established that carbonara is prepared with egg yolks, there are also claims thatmaking carbonara with whole eggs is also traditional.        How Much Guanciale          The amount of guanciale varies from recipe to recipe. Some call for merely 25g (0.9 oz) per serving, while otherscall for anywhere from 50g (1.75 oz) to 100 (3.5 oz) per serving.        How To Cut The Guanciale          Guanciale can be cut either into strips or into dices. Cutting guanciale into strips makes for a crispier,crunchier guanciale once browned, especially if it’s cut very thin, while cutting guanciale into dices willproduce guanciale that is crisp on the outside but soft on the inside, meaning the upon biting into one, the faton the inside would explode in one’s mouth.        Browning Guanciale          Guanciale is to be sautéed over low heat, and no fats or oils should be added to the pan beforehand. The excessrendered fat can be removed, if desired, by soaking it up with a paper towel or by draining the guanciale anddiscarding the fat. If the fat and the guanciale burns, it should not be used but thrown away, and a new batchshould be fried.        Guanciale Substitutes          If not available, guanciale or cured pork jowl can be substituted with Italian pancetta (unsmoked) or even bacon,preferably of higher quality. However, while browning guanciale doesn’t really require using extra fat, pancettaand bacon are often browned in lard or olive oil, while some recipes opt for butter. In any case, guanciale, orits substitutes, should be fried over medium heat, until lightly browned and rendered.        Cheese          Traditionally, the best cheese is Italian pecorino (sheep cheese), preferably the Pecorino Romano variety, but itcan be partially or entirely substituted with Parmigiano-Reggiano. However, this will make for a much saltiercarbonara sauce, especially if combined with pancetta or bacon, so take note and cut back on the salt when cookingpasta. Also, because Pecorino Romano cheese is a hard-melting cheese, it’s crucial that it’s grated finely inorder to advance its melting properties.        Pasta          Spaghetti may be the standard choice of pasta, but other types of pasta like fettuccine, rigatoni, bucatini,macherroni, and penne also work well with the carbonara sauce.        Cooking The Pasta          Even though Italians say that the water for cooking pasta should be salty as the Mediterranean when preparingspaghetti alla carbonara, this rule should not be followed to a tee, as both guanciale and Pecorino Romano cheeseprovide sufficient saltiness. Also, since starchy water in which the pasta was cooked adds to the creaminess ofthe sauce, halving the amount of water typically used to boil pasta will produce an ultra-starchy leftover liquid,which is one of the secrets to a velvety-smooth carbonara sauce. Because pasta will continue to cook with thesauce, it should not be completely cooked but be taken out of the water just shy of al dente. Also, when done, itshould not be well-drained but instead should be taken out of the water with pliers, as residual starch liquidimproves the creaminess of the sauce.        Cream          Using cream is strictly forbidden and known as the biggest mistake in making spaghetti alla carbonara. The creamis heavy and cloying, especially when reduced, and adding it to carbonara turns this delicate pasta sauce into athick sludge. However, some chefs like to add it because it expands the amount of time the carbonara sauce stayscreamy — carbonara, when made traditionally, turns dry quickly and needs to be served right away, before thathappens.        Additional Ingredients          In modern iterations of the recipe, garlic is often used, but only to infuse the oil; it is disposed of afterward.According to some chefs, a splash of white wine is a welcomed addition, as are onions, while some like to add apop of color in the form of roughly chopped parsley.        Serving          While preparing spaghetti alla carbonara, it is recommended to warm the serving bowls/plates, as this will keepthe carbonara sauce creamy for longer. Also, carbonara should be served right after it’s been prepared, as thesauce turns dry very quickly.      "

Place sunflower oil in a deep fryer and heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  Add some zucchini to the hot oil and deep-fry until lightly browned, 4 to 5 minutes.  Transfer to a single layer on paper towels to drain and repeat to cook remaining zucchini.  Let zucchini cool to room temperature.  Transfer cooled zucchini to a bowl. Cover and refrigerate, 8 hours to overnight.  Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally,until it’s 2 minutes away from being tender yet firm to the bite, 9 to 10 minutes.  As you are cooking the spaghetti, heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat.  Add zucchini and salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until it starts to release juices, soften, and break down,3 to 5 minutes. Also add garlic, if using  Add a couple splashes of the pasta water to the zucchini, but don’t overdo it.  Break zucchini into small pieces with the edge of a spoon or spatula.  Reduce heat to low and toss in basil and butter; stir until butter melts.  Grab spaghetti with tongs and transfer it right into the sauce; stir until coated.  Mix in Pecorino Romano and Parmigiano-Reggiano cheeses.  Add a final splash of pasta water and adjust salt if needed.  Serve with more grated cheese, fresh basil, pepper, and optional butter.Chef’s Notes  Use any zucchini from your garden; different types and sizes are fine.  If your deep fryer is small, you can use a Dutch oven instead and fry more zucchini at a time.  You can add a clove of minced garlic when making the sauce if you want.  Use grated provolone del Monoco cheese if you can find it. I used 1/2 Parmesan cheese and 1/2 Toma cheese."
