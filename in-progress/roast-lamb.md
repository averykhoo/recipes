# todo - roast lamb chops

https://www.themediterraneandish.com/roast-lamb-rack-recipe/

* 3 tbsp dry rosemary
* 1 tbsp oregano
* 1 tbsp thyme
* 1 tsp paprika
* 1 tsp salt (can try up to 1 tbsp, it wasn't salty enough)
* 1 tsp pepper
* 20-30 cloves raw garlic
* about 1/2 cup olive oil

1. Blend into a smooth paste. If too solid, add olive oil. If too liquid, add everything except olive oil.
2. Prepare a rack of lamb (8-9 ribs) but frenching it and cutting between the bones from the meat side, leaving them
   attached via the fat cap layer. Also score the fat cap diagonally and not too deeply. Optionally wrap some foil
   around the bits of bone sticking out to prevent it from burning, but this is just for appearances.
3. Slather all over the rack, as well as into the cuts and scores, and store in the fridge in a ziploc bag for a few
   hours or days. The pastiness of the garlic should help it stick on fairly well.
4. Preheat the oven to 120C and roast for 25-30 minutes
5. Poke around inside the cut between the bones to see how red it looks
6. Increase the temperature to 160-180C and finish for 5-10 minutes
7. To serve, just slice the fat cap in the appropriate locations. Also have mint sauce and/or jelly, and maybe some
   red wine shallot (Bordelaise) sauce.
