# Potage Parmentier (Leek & Potato Soup)

* 1-2 tbsp butter
* 2 biggish leeks, sliced to cook quickly and evenly (about 1 pound / 400g)
* 2 cloves garlic, sliced or minced
* 2 large russet potatoes, peeled and diced (about 400g)
* 3-4 cups light chicken stock, veg broth, or water
* 0.5-1 cup milk or cream, or 1-2 tbsp butter to finish
* salt and pepper to taste (probably about 1 tsp each)
* chives or dill to garnish

1. fry the leek and garlic in butter until softened and translucent, about 5 mins
2. blend the leek and cold/room-temp stock in a blender until smooth
3. return stock to pot, add potatoes, and boil until tender, about 20 mins
4. remove potatoes with a slotted spoon and squish through a potato press back into the pot
5. add cream and bring to a simmer
6. add salt and pepper to taste

Notes:

* a food mill can replace the blender and potato ricer
* don't blend hot stock
* bay, thyme, and marjoram can be added, just be sure to remove the leaf / twigs before serving
