# 100 second poached yellow croaker a la putien

> The original taste of the fish is thus accentuated as the dish uses minimal seasoning of onions, ginger, Fujian aged wine and Puning bean sauce

1. scale, fillet, debone, and keep the fish in salt water
2. pressure cook the fish bones and bits for maybe an hour (about 1.5-2l water), then take out just the clear soup after manually stopping the pressure cook - do not allow the auto rapid depressurization to avoid closing the soup (the remaining fish bits can be pressure cooker again normally to produce a decent broth for noodles or something)
3. boil 2 slices ginger, half an onion, 1tsp miso, and 1tsp sake with the fish in the clear soup
4. scoop out the fish into a bowl until ready to serve
5. pour hot soup onto fish and garnish with parsley to serve
