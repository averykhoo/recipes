## ingredients

* big fat chili peppers, seeds and pith thoroughly removed
* meat
* garlic
* paprika
* cumin
* salt and pepper
* oregano
* onion or green onion
* cheese
* spring roll wrappers, egg or rice rolls okay
* clove, fennel, worcestershire, light soy sauce, liquid smoke

---

notes:

* beef is done taco or quesadilla style in this recipe
* wear gloves when de-seeding the chili
* wrap at least 2 layers thick for crunchiness - use a huge spring roll or wrap it twice
* meat can be raw when stuffing, but is sometimes thoroughly precooked
* optional egg to hold the meat together, and to glue the wrap closed
* try to un-curve the chili if shallow-frying
* allow to cool on a wire rack or paper towels to allow oil to drain and avoid molten cheese burning your tongue
* ketchup mayo (and traditionally sriracha) dip works well
*
