# Pesto (from Thai basil)

* leaves from 3 bunches of thai basil (about 200g dry)
    * these basil leaves are larger than holy basil, and don't smell like mint
    * each bunch costs about $2 at the thai supermarket at golden mile
        * note: they're moving to aperia mall near lavender in april 2023
* 0.8 cups of decently good olive oil (160g)
* 1 tsp salt
* 2 heads / 12-15 cloves raw garlic, peeled (60g)
  * use up to 3 heads garlic
* 1/2 cup pine nuts (100g)
* 1/3 cup freshly grated parmegiano (10-20g)
    * if using the pre-packaged powdered parmesan cheese, use 3/4 to 1 cup since its really weak
    * note from 2023-02-19:
        * used 1 cup (60g) of grated gran moravia (hard cheese) since that was in the fridge
        * using 2/3 cup (40g) was still too little

1. add oil to blender
2. add basil leaves - about 1/3 of the leaves will fit
3. blend in the leaves
4. add basil leaves and blend repeatedly until all the leaves are in
5. add the salt, garlic, pine nuts, and cheese
6. blend to combine, and keep blending to form a pasty consistency
7. store in an airtight container for up to a couple months
8. smooth the top surface of the pesto flat with a spatula, and cover with olive oil to prevent oxidation
9. it does not need to be cooked before eating - that also weakens the garlic flavor
10. the oil preventing oxidation is not wasted - it tastes pretty good after absorbing the basil flavor
