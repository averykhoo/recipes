## Ingredients

* 1 (9½ by 9-inch) sheet frozen puff pastry, thawed (overnight in the fridge)
* 1 egg, lightly beaten
* 1 small (8-ounce/5-inch) wheel firm Brie cheese, sliced in half into top and bottom circles
* handful of chopped berries and/or nuts

## Directions

1. Trim the pastry to a 9-inch circle with a paring knife - it must be larger than the diameter of the cheese
2. Place the bottom half of the wheel in the center of the circle, fill with berries/nuts, and place the top
3. Brush the pastry edges lightly with the beaten egg, wrap, and crimp the top (the top center may remain open)
4. Brush the exterior of the pastry with beaten egg and transfer to a parchment-lined baking sheet.
5. Freeze for 20-60 minutes - do not skip this step
6. Adjust an oven rack to the middle position and heat the oven to 220C
7. Bake the cheese until the exterior is a deep golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes.
8. Transfer to a wire rack to cool for about 30 minutes
