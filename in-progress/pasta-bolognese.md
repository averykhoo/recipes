don't forget the nutmeg and dairy
about 50-65g dried pasta per person (500g packet of dried pasta usually feeds 8-10)
and pepper is important too

## ingredients, part 1

* 2 carrots
* 1 onion
* 2 stalks celery
* 1 red capsicum, cored
* 500g cherry tomatoes
* 5 cloves garlic, peeled
* 1 cup chicken or beef stock
* optional herbs

## ingredients, part 2

* 100g bacon (or 50g beef fat plus a bit of salt), sliced very thinly and cut into small bits
* 250g ground mutton
* 250g ground beef
* optional 250g more minced pork
* 100g chicken livers, blended into a liquidy paste
* herbs & spices (oregano, fresh rosemary, parsley, bay, nutmeg, ...?)
* 1 tsp worcestershire sauce, of half the amount of fish sauce
* up to 1 tbsp tomato paste
* 1/4 to 1 cup red wine
* up to 1/2 cup milk (skip if using this for lasagna)
* optional:
    * gelatin
    * mushroom
    * parmesan

## directions, part 1

1. blend/dice/mince the carrot, onion, celery, and capsicum
2. fry with little to no oil until well cooked through
3. add chopped tomatoes and garlic and cook, covered, until garlic is fragrant
4. add stock and optional herbs and cook, covered, until it looks about done
5. reserve in an airtight container in the fridge for up to a week, or in the freezer for maybe a month

## directions, part 2

1. fry the bacon to render the fat
2. add the rest of the meat and fry until no longer raw
3. turn off the heat and stir in the chicken liver until everything is coated
4. mix in herbs, tomato sauce from part 1, and a dash of worcestershire
5. if the sauce isn't tomatoey enough, scoot everything over to the side, fry the tomato paste, then mix in
6. cook without stirring much until browned at the bottom of the pan
7. deglaze with wine and stir well to combine; repeat these 2 steps until you've added all the wine you want to add
8. add milk and stir, letting it be fully absorbed

notes:

* to do this in one pipeline: fry the soffrito in bacon fat, then add meat, then tomatoes, garlic, herbs, spices
* for lasagna: omit milk and nutmeg, and consider using more (maybe 2x?) tomatoes
