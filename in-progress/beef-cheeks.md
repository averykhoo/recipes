* yields 2 portions
* https://www.recipetineats.com/slow-cooker-red-wine-beef-cheeks/

## ingredients

* 1 beef cheek
* 1-2 cups chicken or beef stock
* 0.5 cup wine
* thyme, bay, rosemary
* onion, carrot, celery, garlic - coarsely chopped
* salt and pepper
* gelatin
* butter

## directions

1. (optional) briefly sear cheeks in hot butter to brown the outsides
2. slow-cook all ingredients at 64C for 24 hours (or 70C for 2 hours if you're in a rush)
3. strain out the poky herbs (ie dried rosemary) and cook the glaze down to thicken it
4. slice the beef cheek against the grain
5. finish the sauce with butter and serve over the beef cheek

## notes

* for chuck or shortrib do 58C for 48-72 hours
* using the multi-cooker's "sous vide" mode means just slow-cooking it at a low temperature
* there's no need to bother with sealing it in a bag, since it's beef in stock
