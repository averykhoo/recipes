# QUICK & EASY LEG OF HAM

Catherine's short-cut, Dec-2010

## Ingredients

* 2kg fully-cooked ham

## Directions

1. Carefully slice off the rind, leaving the fat on
2. Score the fat in a diamond pattern, without cutting into the meat.
3. Prick each diamond with a toothpick, and pierce with a clove.
4. Brush on honey all around the ham, generously.
5. Place ham in a roasting pan, preferably on a rack.
6. Bake at 160C, about 15 minutes.
7. Brush again with honey and return to oven for 30 minutes till golden brown.

N.B.

* While removing the rind, leave all of the fat on the meat.
* The layer of fat keeps the meat moist.
* Spread the honey/sugar mixture directly on the fat, roasting it to a golden brown â€“
* i.e. the delicious sugar crust is immediately carved, served with the meat & fat, without the rind.
* Allow each guest to lay aside the fat uneaten on their plate.

### Storage

From Australian Woolworth's mag, Dec-2010

(This really works!)

For leftovers, to store ham on the bone:

1. Wrap it loosely with a clean tea towel (or cotton sheet) which has been rinsed in water and vinegar.  (Be sure to
   wring out excess liquid).
2. Store in the refrigerator with plenty of room as the air must be able to circulate around the ham.
3. Change the tea towel every day.
4. Once opened, do not store ham in its original packaging.
5. Stored properly, the ham will last for up to 2 weeks, without having to freeze it.
