Ingredients

* 1 ½ cups【355 mL】 all-purpose flour
* 3 ½ teaspoons baking powder
* 1 tablespoon white sugar
* ¼ teaspoon salt, or more to taste
* 1 ¼ cups【296 mL】 milk
* 3 tablespoons butter, melted
* 1 egg

Directions
Sift flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt together in a large bowl. Make a well in the center and add milk, melted
butter, and egg; mix until smooth.

Heat a lightly oiled griddle or pan over medium-high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using
approximately 1/4 cup【59 mL】 for each pancake; cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, about 2 to 3 minutes. Flip
and cook until browned on the other side. Repeat with remaining batter.

Editor's Note:
The salt amount has been reduced based on review feedback. The original recipe called for 1 teaspoon.

I found this pancake recipe in my Grandma's recipe book. Judging from the weathered look of this recipe card, this was a
family favorite.

Perfect pancakes are easier to make than you think. This pancake recipe produces thick, fluffy, and all-around delicious
pancakes with just a few ingredients that are probably already in your kitchen (and it's so much better than the boxed
stuff).

How to Make Pancakes
You'll find a detailed ingredient list and step-by-step instructions in the recipe below, but let's go over the basics:

Pancake Ingredients
You likely already have everything you need to make this pancake recipe. If not, here's what to add to your grocery
list:

* Flour: This homemade pancake recipe starts with all-purpose flour.
* Baking powder: Baking powder, a leavener, is the secret to fluffy pancakes.
* Sugar: Just a tablespoon of white sugar is all you'll need for subtly sweet pancakes.
* Salt: A pinch of salt will enhance the overall flavor without making your pancakes taste salty.
* Milk and butter: Milk and butter add moisture and richness to the pancakes.
* Egg: A whole egg lends even more moisture. Plus, it helps bind the pancake batter together.

How to Make Pancakes From Scratch
It's not hard to make homemade pancakes — you just need a good recipe. That's where we come in! You'll find the
step-by-step recipe below, but here's a brief overview of what you can expect:

1. Sift the dry ingredients together.
2. Make a well, then add the wet ingredients. Stir to combine.
3. Scoop the batter onto a hot griddle or pan.
4. Cook for two to three minutes, then flip.
5. Continue cooking until brown on both sides.

When to Flip Pancakes
Your pancake will tell you when it's ready to flip. Wait until bubbles start to form on the top and the edges look dry
and set. This will usually take about two to three minutes on each side.

How to Reheat Pancakes
Store leftover pancakes in an airtight container in the fridge for about a week. Refrain from adding toppings (such as
syrup) until right before you serve them so the pancakes don't get soggy.

Can You Save Pancake Batter?
Don't let leftover pancake batter go to waste! Store the batter in an airtight container in the fridge for up to two
days. If you plan to keep it longer than that, it's best to freeze the batter.

Can You Freeze Pancakes?
Yes, you can freeze pancakes and pancake batter.

· To freeze cooked pancakes: Allow the pancakes to cool completely, then arrange them in a single layer on a baking
sheet (make sure the edges aren't touching). Flash freeze for a few hours or up to overnight. Reheat in an oven set to
350 degrees F【177°C】 until warmed through.
· To freeze pancake batter: Ladle the pancake batter in serving size portions into freezer bags, then wrap the bags in
foil. Freeze flat for up to one month. Thaw in the refrigerator overnight.

Allrecipes Community Tips and Praise
"This recipe is one to hand down to your grandkids," raves ashleyalbertine. "Fluffy and delicious. Haven't bought a box
of pancake mix in months! Just add a bit of vanilla and poof! Magic."

"Perfect," according to Laura W. "Delicious! If you're looking for some thick, hearty pancakes these are the ones to
make! Made them exactly as the recipe states and then added mini-chocolate chips to each cake as they were on the frying
pan (before flipping)."

"I made this recipe exactly as written...the kids were eating them off the plate faster than I could cook them," says
aellis1970. "They are so delicious, they were eaten without syrup."
