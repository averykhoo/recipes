Note: a cocotte is a type of heavy pot with a tight-fitting lid - basically a dutch oven.

## Ingredients:

* 1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil
* 1 large onion (230 g), coarsely chopped
* 2 red peppers (280 g), cut into 1 cm / 1/2" cubes
* 1/2 eggplant (280 g), cut into 2 cm / 1" cubes

3. Preheat a cocotte over medium heat for 5 minutes.
4. Add the olive oil to the cocotte.

8. Add the tomato and cook for an additional 10 minutes.
