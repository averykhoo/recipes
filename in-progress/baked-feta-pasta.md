Ingredients

* 1/3 cup olive oil, the good stuff
* 500g cherry tomatoes, halved
* 200g-227g feta cheese (1 block)
* 2-4 cloves garlic, squashed flat or cut in half lengthwise
* (optional) 1-2 shallots, quartered
* (optional) chili flakes
* salt and pepper
* 450g pasta
* salt
* fresh basil, chopped, to finish

Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 400°F / 200°C.
2. In a large baking dish, toss the tomatoes, crushed garlic, and quartered shallots with the olive oil.
3. Place the feta in the middle, turning it to coat it in oil.
4. Season everything with salt and pepper and bake for 15-30 minutes.
5. After 30 minutes, turn the heat up to 450°F / 230°C and roast until the feta is golden brown 10-15 minutes.
6. While the feta is baking, cook the pasta according to the package directions.
7. Save 1-2 cups of the pasta water, then drain well.
8. When the feta and tomatoes are done, remove from the oven.
9. Immediately add crushed red pepper, if using.
10. Stir everything together until the tomatoes and feta combine into a creamy sauce.
11. Stir in the drained pasta until well coated and creamy, adding in a bit of pasta water to loosen if too thick.
12. Taste and season with salt and pepper.
13. Stir in some chopped basil and finish with crushed red pepper. Enjoy!

Notes

* cherry tomatoes – the sweeter the better! There are so many types of mini tomatoes these days, from strawberry to
  grape to on the vine to heirloom. I used one package of classic cherry tomatoes and one package of cherry tomatoes on
  the vine.
* feta – you’ll want to get a nice higher quality Greek feta since it’s the main flavor of the dish. Grab a block of
  feta, the kind that comes in a brine, not the crumbles. If you want a milder, creamier feta, try French feta, it’s
  less tart than Greek.
* olive oil – most of the recipes I’ve seen call from anywhere from 1/4 to 1/2 cup of olive oil. I went with 1/3 cup,
  you want enough to coat the tomatoes and feta while having a bit of oil pool at the bottom of your baking dish so the
  tomatoes are essentially doing a tomato confit type thing. Too little olive oil and your tomatoes will end up drying
  out.
* pasta – you can use any shape you like, we went with casarecce the first time and rotini the second time and both were
  great.
* garlic – a couple cloves of minced garlic are mixed in and the residual heat of the tomatoes mellows the sharpness out
  while still giving you a huge hit of garlicky goodness.
* basil – fresh basil and tomatoes are perfect pairing. Slice some up to stir in and keep some extra leaves whole to
  garnish with!
