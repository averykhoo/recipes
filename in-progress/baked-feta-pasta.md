# tiktok baked feta pasta

* cherry tomatoes – the sweeter the better! There are so many types of mini tomatoes these days, from strawberry to
  grape to on the vine to heirloom. I used one package of classic cherry tomatoes and one package of cherry tomatoes on
  the vine.
* feta – you’ll want to get a nice higher quality Greek feta since it’s the main flavor of the dish. Grab a block of
  feta, the kind that comes in a brine, not the crumbles. If you want a milder, creamier feta, try French feta, it’s
  less tart than Greek.
* olive oil – most of the recipes I’ve seen call from anywhere from 1/4 to 1/2 cup of olive oil. I went with 1/3 cup,
  you want enough to coat the tomatoes and feta while having a bit of oil pool at the bottom of your baking dish so the
  tomatoes are essentially doing a tomato confit type thing. Too little olive oil and your tomatoes will end up drying
  out.
* pasta – you can use any shape you like, we went with casarecce the first time and rotini the second time and both were
  great.
* garlic – a couple cloves of minced garlic are mixed in and the residual heat of the tomatoes mellows the sharpness out
  while still giving you a huge hit of garlicky goodness.
* basil – fresh basil and tomatoes are perfect pairing. Slice some up to stir in and keep some extra leaves whole to
  garnish with!
* shallots - optional

1. Toss: In a baking dish, toss cherry tomatoes with olive oil. Place a block of feta in the middle and drizzle some oil
   on top.
2. Bake: Bake the tomatoes and feta in the oven until the tomatoes burst and the cheese is melty.
3. Cook: While the feta is in the oven, cook the pasta.
4. Stir: When the tomatoes and feta are done, stir in some minced garlic, some crushed red pepper flakes, and the pasta,
   loosening with some pasta water if needed. Finish with fresh basil.
5. Eat: That’s it! Scoop it up an enjoy a bowl of pure cheesy carby comfort.
