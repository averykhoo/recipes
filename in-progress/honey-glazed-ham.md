# Honey Glaze (for roast ham)

> IMPORTANT:<br>
> Make sure to cut off the actual ham skin (but leaving behind the fat layer) because that's pretty much inedible.
> After cutting one way, remove the skin in strips before cutting the other way to make the diamond hatch. 

* 1/2 cup honey
* 1/4 cup maple syrup
* 1/4 cup (brown) sugar
* 2 Tbsp butter
* 1 Tbsp mustard
* 2 pinches cinnamon
* 1 pinch nutmeg
* (optional) splash of white wine

1. Mix and boil everything except the wine until foamy and homogenous
2. Keep boiling until sticky
3. Add a bit of wine to loosen it up, so that it can be painted onto ham
4. Keep in the fridge until ready to paint the ham
5. Defrost out of the fridge for an hour to liquefy
6. Paint on a whole ham or on ham slices

Notes:

* need to figure out how to make the ham skin crispy without overcooking the inside - maybe glaze the ham after it's crispy?
