# Miso Soup

Ingredients:

* 4-5 cups (~1 liter) dashi (either kombu or bonito is fine)
* 1-2 tbsp mirin or ryorishu (optional)
* 4-6 tbsp miso paste
* 100-200g silken (kinugoshi) tofu, cut into 1/2 inch (~1.5 cm) cubes
* 1-2 tsp dried wakame
* 1 spring onion, sliced thinly

Instructions:

1. In a large pot, bring the dashi to a boil and add the mirin.
2. Stir in the wakame and let it rehydrate.
3. Turn off the heat and allow a few minutes the dashi to cool (to approximately 95Â°C).
4. Using a ladle, mix 4 tablespoons of miso into the soup to prevent clumping. Taste and add the remaining 2 tablespoons
   as necessary. Do not boil the miso. As an option, you can mix it through a strainer to discard any solid bits for a
   smoother final consistency.
5. Add the sliced spring onions to the pot. Also add the tofu, but do that gently.
6. Using a soup ladle, scoop the soup into individual bowls, taking care not to break the tofu. Serve hot and enjoy!

Notes:

* The amount of miso required depends on the concentration of the dashi and the type and saltiness of the miso. It's
  better to taste and adjust upwards.
* The mirin is totally optional, but helps the flavor profile.
