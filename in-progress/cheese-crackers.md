makes about 30-35 crackers, or 6-8 shortbread brick cookies 

* 2 tablespoons room temperature unsalted butter
* 3 ounces【85 g】 sharp cheddar cheese, grated (about 3/4 cup【177 mL】 lightly packed)
* 1 ounce【28 g】 Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, finely grated (about 1/3 cup【79 mL】 lightly packed)
* 1/2 tsp paprika
* pinch of cayenne (skipped)
* 1/4 teaspoon salt
* 1/2 cup【118 mL】 all-purpose flour (2.25 oz【64 g】 by weight)
* 1 tablespoon cold water

1. Cream together the butter, cheese, spices, and salt. Use a fork.
2. Add flour and keep mixing to form sand.
3. Add just enough cold water to make it come together. Possibly no water will be needed.
4. Optionally chill in the fridge or freezer to make it easier to roll out
5. Flour a work surface and the dough itself, which is hopefully already in the shape of a disk.
6. Roll out the dough, then cut into shapes.
7. Dock the dough (make dots with a fork or something) to allow some steam to escape.
8. Bake at 180C for 10-15 minutes.
9. Allow to cool slightly before picking them up.
10. Store in an airtight container.

Notes:

* maybe a bit of sugar would be nice
* can substitute with 4oz of almost any cheese
* a tiny bit more butter might help, but then expect not to need any water
* if you make brick shapes (like shortbread cookies) then maybe freeze before baking to keep the shape
