# pink sauce pasta

note: for this to turn out pink and not orange, the tomatoes must be red and not orange

## ingredients

1. fry bacon and halved cherry tomatoes (and pepper - salt comes from pasta water)
2. add chicken stock to help tomatoes to cook
3. also add herbs if desired
4. reduce until dry, but not burned so the sauce doesn't turn brown
5. add some tomato puree or coulis or sauce (not ketchup)
6. cook to reduce
7. boil some pasta, leave it a bit underdone, then reserve the water
8. add pasta to sauce and reduce until a bit too thick
9. keep adding pasta water and reducing until everything looks cooked
10. add cream
11. cheese and salt to taste
12. add a bit more chicken stock if it's too sticky/starchy
13. serve with pine nuts and maybe basil leaves
