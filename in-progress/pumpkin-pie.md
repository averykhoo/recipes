Ingredients:

* 3 1/2 cups [fresh cooked](#fresh-cooked-pumpkin-puree) or canned pumpkin (one 29-ounce can will do)
* 4 large eggs, lightly beaten
* 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1 teaspoon ground ginger (dried powder)
* 1 teaspoon ground cloves
* 1 teaspoon ground mace
* 1 1/2 cups granulated sugar
* 3 cups heavy cream or 2 12-ounce cans evaporated milk (or replace up to 1/3 of the cream with milk)
* 2 unbaked, 9-inch pie shells
* [Whipped cream (optional)](../recipes/chantilly-cream.md)

Procedures:

1. Optionally, put pumpkin in nonstick saucepan and stir over direct heat for 10 minutes until somewhat dry and slightly
   caramelized, stirring frequently. Remove from heat but keep hot.
2. Adjust oven rack to the middle upper position and preheat the oven to 400-425°F. (200-220°C)
3. Place pumpkin in a large mixing bowl and whisk in beaten eggs (once the pumpkin is moderately cool, if it was cooked)
   . Add the cinnamon, salt, ginger, cloves, and mace and whisk to thoroughly combine. Gradually add the sugar, followed
   by the heavy cream, whisking until all ingredients are incorporated.
4. Divide the pumpkin filling between the two pie shells. Transfer the pies to the oven and bake for 15 minutes.
5. Reduce the oven temperature to 350°F (160c) and continue baking until the filling is just set in the center of each
   pie and the crust is deep golden brown, about 40-45 minutes. Let the pies cool to room temperature before cutting and
   serving. Top with powdered sugar and whipped cream, if desired.

## ALTERNATIVE: Pumpkin Meringue Pie

Makes one 9-inch pie

For the Pie:

* 2 cups fresh cooked or canned pumpkin (one 15-ounce can will do) (recipe follows)
* 4 egg yolks
* 3/4 cup dark brown sugar
* 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
* 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 1/2 teaspoon ground mace
* 1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
* One 9-inch blind-baked piecrust

For the Meringue:

* 4 egg whites
* Pinch cream of tartar
* 1/2 cup granulated sugar

Procedures:

1. Preheat the oven to 350°F.
2. Place the pumpkin in a large, heatproof mixing bowl and whisk in the egg yolks. Add the brown sugar, cinnamon,
   ginger, salt, mace, and cloves and whisk until well combined.
3. Set the bowl over a pot of simmering water over medium-low heat. Cook the filling, stirring constantly, until it
   deepens in color and thickens, about 10 minutes. Remove the bowl from the heat and scrape the filling into the pie
   shell, smoothing it out with a rubber spatula. Set aside.
4. Put the egg whites and cream of tartar in the bowl of a standing mixer and beat on medium speed until frothy.
   Increase the speed to medium-high. Continue beating, gradually adding the granulated sugar, one tablespoon or so at a
   time. Increase the speed to high and beat until the whites are glossy and stiff and the sugar is completely
   dissolved, 2 to 5 minutes.
5. Cover the pumpkin filling with big spoonfuls of meringue, beginning at the edges and working toward the center of the
   pie. Make sure the meringue covers and attaches itself to the edges of the crust or it will shrink inward as the pie
   bakes.
6. Transfer to the oven and bake until the meringue peaks are golden brown, 10 to 12 minutes. Let the pie cool
   completely on a wire rack before serving.

## Fresh-Cooked Pumpkin Puree
Ingredients:

* 6-pound cheese or Cinderella pumpkin, halved horizontally

Procedures:

1. Preheat the oven to 400°F.
2. Place the pumpkin halves cut-side up on a baking pan and cover tightly with foil. Bake until the flesh is tender when
   pierced with a knife, about 1 hour. Remove from the oven and set aside to let cool.
3. Scoop out and discard the seeds. Scoop out the flesh and let drain in a colander for about 30 minutes.
4. Transfer the flesh to a medium bowl and mash with a fork to smooth out any lumps. The cooked pumpkin can be stored in
   a covered container in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.
