# Sambal Bawang (Garlic Chili Sauce)

from Ati

* 380g cleaned deseeded chili
* 100g garlic
* 1 cup oil <- todo: not sure about this amount
* 1 tsp salt
* 1/2 tsp chicken bouillon powder (alternatively, a pinch of msg)
* 1/8 tsp sugar (if not adding msg)

1. Blend chili and garlic until they're about 3mm across
2. Get the oil very hot (otherwise it'll be bitter)
3. Fry the chili and garlic until it's dry-ish (i.e. stops bubbling)
4. When the garlic is lightly browned (mixture looks orange), add the salt, chicken powder, and sugar
5. Reduce heat to low (to avoid burning the garlic) and continue cooking to fully dehydrate the chili and garlic 
6. When it's cooked, it'll look like the oil is coming out of the chili
