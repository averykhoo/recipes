Gyudon but with lamb and beef/chicken stock

Based on a normal gyudon recipe, but with some substitutions

1. Slice lamb/mutton into thin chunks
2. Sear on both sides, then reserve separately
    1. Do NOT remove the lamb juices from the pan
3. Add beef/chicken stock (or dashi to be authentic) and deglaze
4. Add sliced (orange) carrot (roll cut), sliced onions (slice towards the center), and optional sliced garlic
    1. Optionally add a tiny amount of finely julienned ginger - maybe 3-5mm worth
5. Add a splash of soy sauce and mirin; equal amounts, but not too salty
6. Add lamb back and cover, cooking until lamb is tender
7. Add sliced green onions / chopped scallions, and some cracked black pepper
8. Serve with rice
