## Notes:

* Try bread flour?
* if using cocoa powder in place of chocolate:
    * use 80g
    * stir into browned butter
    * add cold cream amd mix in
    * be warned that the brownie's texture will be a bit spongy and dry
    * also it'll taste too eggy, maybe use 4 whole eggs instead of 3 + 2 yolks
* Large eggs, 55-60g
