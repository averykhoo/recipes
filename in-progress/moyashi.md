# Japanese-ish Beansprouts

Ingredients:

* 200 to 300 grams of bean sprouts
* 3 tablespoons shoyu (soy sauce)
* 2 tablespoons toasted sesame oil
* 1 tablespoon tahini
* 1 teaspoon vinegar
* 1/4 teaspoon black pepper
* 1/4 teaspoon sugar
* 1/8 teaspoon salt
* 1/8 teaspoon shichimi togarashi (Japanese seven-spice blend)

Instructions:

1. Fill a large pot with salted water and bring to a boil.
2. Add the bean sprouts to the boiling water and blanch for 1-2 minutes.
3. Drain the bean sprouts but keep them in the pan. Allow the dampness to evaporate off the warm sprouts.
4. In a small bowl, whisk together the shoyu, sesame oil, tahini, vinegar, pepper, sugar, salt, and shichimi.
5. Pour the sauce over the bean sprouts and toss until the sprouts are evenly coated.
6. Stir-fry for 1-2 minutes or until the sauce is sticky and adheres to the sprouts.
