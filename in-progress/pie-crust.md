note: make the full recipe, the crust was too thin with half a recipe

lazy to edit so pasting the whole page here first

* 2 ½ cups (325 grams) all-purpose flour
* 1 teaspoon kosher salt or use 1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt
* 1 tablespoon sugar, optional
* 1 cup (230 grams) very cold unsalted butter, cut into 1/2-inch【1.27 cm】 cubes (2 sticks)
* 4 to 8 tablespoons ice water

METHOD WHEN USING FOOD PROCESSOR

1. Add 1 ½ cups【355 mL】 flour, salt, and sugar (optional) to a food processor. Pulse 2 to 3 times until combined. The
   remaining cup of flour will be added later.
2. Scatter butter cubes over flour and process until a dough or paste begins to form, about 15 seconds. (There should be
   no uncoated flour).
3. Scrape bowl, redistribute the flour-butter mixture then add remaining 1 cup【237 mL】 of flour. Pulse 4 to 5 times
   until flour is evenly distributed. (Dough should look broken up and a little crumbly).
4. Transfer to a medium bowl then sprinkle ice water over mixture — start with 4 tablespoons and add from there. Using a
   rubber spatula, press the dough into itself. The crumbs should begin to form larger clusters. If you pinch some of
   the dough and it holds together, it’s ready. If the dough falls apart, add 2 to 4 more tablespoons of water and
   continue to press until dough comes together.
5. Remove dough from bowl and place in a mound on a clean surface. Work the dough just enough to form a ball. Cut the
   ball in half then form each half into discs. Wrap each disc with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour and
   up to 2 days. You can also freeze it for up to 3 months (just thaw it overnight in the fridge before using it).
