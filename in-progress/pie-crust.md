note: make the full recipe, the crust was too thin with half a recipe

lazy to edit so pasting the whole page here first

* 2 ½ cups (325 grams) all-purpose flour
* 1 teaspoon kosher salt or use 1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt
* 1 tablespoon sugar, optional
* 1 cup (230 grams) very cold unsalted butter, cut into 1/2-inch【1.27 cm】 cubes (2 sticks)
* 4 to 8 tablespoons ice water

METHOD WHEN MAKING BY HAND

1. Add 1 1/2 cups【355 mL】 flour, salt and sugar (optional) to a medium bowl. Stir 2 to 3 times until combined.
2. Scatter butter cubes over flour and mix briefly with a fork or spatula to coat the butter with flour.
3. Cut the butter into the flour with a pastry blender, working mixture until the flour has a coarse, mealy texture
   similar to fresh bread crumbs. About 1 – 2 minutes.
4. Add remaining 1 cup【237 mL】 of flour. Work butter and flour with the pastry blender until flour is evenly
   distributed. About 20 seconds. (Dough should look crumbly with pea-sized pieces).
5. Sprinkle ice water over the mixture — start with 4 tablespoons and add from there. Using a rubber spatula, press the
   dough into itself. The crumbs should begin to form larger clusters. If you pinch some of the dough and it holds
   together, it’s ready. If the dough falls apart, add 2 to 4 more tablespoons of water and continue to press until
   dough comes together.
6. Remove dough from bowl and place in a mound on a clean surface. Work the dough just enough to form a ball. Cut ball
   in half then form each half into discs. Wrap each disc with plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 1 hour, and up to 2
   days. You can also freeze it for up to 3 months (just thaw it overnight in the fridge before using).
