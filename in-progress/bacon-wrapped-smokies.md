* thin bacon
* smokies (small smoked sausages, about 4cm in length)
* bbq seasoning
* optional sugar

1. dry the sausages, wet bacon can't stick
2. cut the bacon to size - at least 4x the diameter of the sausage, measure using 4 sausages
3. wrap sausages - take care not to break the bacon
4. place seam side down on a baking tray
5. sprinkle on bbq seasoning and optional sugar - don't spill, sugar on the tray will burn
6. cook at 170c for 20 mins
7. remove from baking tray and place in serving dish, possibly a disposable aluminum tray
8. bake one last time for 5-10 mins at 190c
9. insert toothpicks last so they don't burn in the oven
10. serve with mustard dip?
