# Japanese-ish Beef Meuniere

* 200g frozen fatty sliced beef
* salt and pepper to season
* flour to dust over / lightly coat
* fry and reserve in a bowl
* 1-2 tsp each shoyu and mirin
* 1-3 tsp sake or wine to deglaze
* 1 tsp butter to finish the sauce
* toss the beef and drippings back in there

Instructions:

1. Season the frozen beef slices with salt and pepper and lightly sprinkle / dust them with flour.
2. In a large frying pan, pan-fry the beef over medium heat until just barely cooked through. It only takes 10 seconds
   to cook each side. Remove the beef from the pan and set it aside in a bowl.
3. Turn off the heat. Add the shoyu and mirin to the pan and swish that around a little to help cool the pan.
4. Pour 1-3 teaspoons of sake or wine into the pan and deglaze. Make sure to get the brown bits off the sides too.
5. Stir in the butter until it has melted and the sauce has thickened slightly.
6. Add the beef and its accumulated juices back into the pan and toss gently to mix and coat with the sauce.
7. Serve immediately and enjoy the tender, juicy beef with its rich, savory sauce.
