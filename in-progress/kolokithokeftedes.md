Ingredients

For Fritters:

* 3 cups packed, grated zucchini (from about 6 large zucchini)
* 6 tablespoons dill, chopped
* 1 bunch (about 8) scallions, white and light green parts finely chopped
* 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg
* 1 1/2 cups crumbled feta
* 4 large eggs, lightly beaten
* 1 cup flour (plus more if needed)
* Salt and pepper
* 4 tablespoons olive oil

For Tzatziki:

* 2 cups greek yogurt - 1 cup might be enough 
* 1 clove of garlic, minced - used 2
* 1/2 cup cucumber, peeled, halved, deseeded, grated, salted, strained for 20 mins, squeezed or patted dry
* 1 teaspoon red wine vinegar or lemon juice
* 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil - used 2
* Salt and pepper

Directions

1. Make Tzatziki: Squeeze excess moisture from cucumber. In a small bowl, mix yogurt, garlic, cucumber. Stir in olive oil. Taste before adding salt. Add pepper and lemon/vinegar to taste.
2. Make Fritters: Lay out a layer of paper towels and spread out grated zucchini. Sprinkle zucchini with salt and let sit for at least thirty minutes and up to an hour. Squeeze out all excess moisture from zucchini.
3. Put drained zucchini in a large bowl with dill, scallions, nutmeg, and feta. Mix to combine. Stir in eggs. Season with salt and pepper. Stir in flour until dough comes together, adding slightly more flour if dough is too wet to form patties. Form dough into 3-4 inch【10.16 cm】 patties.
5. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Fry patties until golden brown on both sides and cooked through but still moist, about 2-3 minutes per side. Serve hot with tzatziki alongside.
