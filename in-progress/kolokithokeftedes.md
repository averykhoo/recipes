## original from seriouseats

For Fritters:

* 3 cups packed, grated zucchini (from about 6 large zucchini)
* 6 tablespoons dill, chopped
* 1 bunch (about 8) scallions, white and light green parts finely chopped
* 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg
* 1 1/2 cups crumbled feta
* 4 large eggs, lightly beaten
* 1 cup flour (plus more if needed)
* Salt and pepper
* 4 tablespoons olive oil

Directions

1. Acquire [Tzatziki](./tzatziki.md)
2. Make Fritters: Lay out a layer of paper towels and spread out grated zucchini. Sprinkle zucchini with salt and let
   sit for at least thirty minutes and up to an hour. Squeeze out all excess moisture from zucchini.
3. Put drained zucchini in a large bowl with dill, scallions, nutmeg, and feta. Mix to combine. Stir in eggs. Season
   with salt and pepper. Stir in flour until dough comes together, adding slightly more flour if dough is too wet to
   form patties. Form dough into 3-4 inch【10.16 cm】 patties.
5. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Fry patties until golden brown on both sides and cooked
   through but still moist, about 2-3 minutes per side. Serve hot with tzatziki alongside.
