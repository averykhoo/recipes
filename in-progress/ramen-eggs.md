# Ramen Eggs (aka "Ajitsuke Tamago" or "Ajitama")

* 7 eggs
* 1/4 cup shoyu
* 1/4 cup mirin
* 1/4 cup sake (optionally less or none, to taste)
* 2 tbsp sugar
* 1/4 - 1/2 cup dashi or water

1. Boil eggs until just about done, about 7 minutes, starting in boiling water
2. Transfer eggs directly into ice bath
3. Peel eggs
4. Mix the marinade
5. Soak eggs in marinade
6. Cover with a paper towel to ensure the top is also wet
7. Keep in fridge for at least 24 hours (and at most 2-3 days, otherwise the marinade will harden the eggs)
8. Slice with a tomato knife or dental floss

Notes:

* Optionally add 1 tbsp of vinegar into the water when boiling the eggs for easier peeling
* Add a teaspoon of dark soy sauce for darker colored eggs
