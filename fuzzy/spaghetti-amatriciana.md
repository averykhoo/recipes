# Spaghetti Amatriciana

makes 3 portions

* olive oil
* 500g fatty pork
* 600-800g cherry tomatoes, halved
* salt and pepper and herbs
* about 250g spaghetti

1. Render fat from the pork over low to medium heat, about 30 mins
2. At the same time, cook the tomatoes with salt, pepper, and herbs (and maybe paprika)
3. Squish the tomatoes when they're squishable, and continue to cook over low heat
4. Once the fat is rendered and the pork is cooked, remove with a slotted spoon and reserve
5. Cook the pasta for 2 minutes less in minimal water with less salt (as all the water goes into the sauce)
6. Pour all the water into the frying pan and mix the fat and starchy water into an emulsion at maximum heat
7. Add the tomato and stir, boiling until the pasta is done and the sauce looks about right
8. Add the pork back
9. Add a lot of pepper
10.
