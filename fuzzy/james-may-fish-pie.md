* Make some mashed potatoes ahead of time
  * optionally add a yolk
  * experiment 2022-11-19: used up excess potato leek mix before it became soup
* 400g of mixed diced fish, poached in 200 mL of milk and some white wine
  * james may also used some prawns, but skip those
* Strain the fish, reserving the milk
* Sweat/sauté 1 large onion (diced) and 1 leek (sliced) in a knob of butter (about the size of a piece of cheese)
* Make a béchamel on top of the aromatics with flour and the poaching milk, which is the semi-liquid stuffing
  * if necessary, deglaze with more wine
* Layer the casserole: fish on bottom, then the onion/leek/béchamel in the middle, and mashed potatoes on top
  * optional crumbled ritz crackers on top for texture
  * or use a fork to texture the top to get more crispy potato topping
* Bake 190°C/375°F for 15-20 minutes
* Allow to cool before digging in
* peas?
