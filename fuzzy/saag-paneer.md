* lots of spinach / fenugreek
* lots of paneer
* ghee
* garlic, ginger, onion, tomato 
* chili, cumin, cinnamon, turmeric, salt, clove, cardamom, bay, garam masala, black pepper, coriander
* fenugreek leaves, yoghurt, cream
* cashew paste for thickening?

1. blanch and chop/blend spinach and fenugreek (mustard leaves). Blanching removes the raw, bitter, and metallic flavor
   of spinach.
2. fry the paneer in ghee until golden and slightly firm (i.e. less crumbly), and reserve
3. fry herbs and spices until aromatic
4. add garlic, ginger, onion, and tomato, and fry over low heat (do not brown, or the dish won't be vibrant green)
5. add paneer, stock, cream, yoghurt, dried fenugreek leaves. You'll get that restaurant-style palak paneer flavor by
   adding dry fenugreek leaves
