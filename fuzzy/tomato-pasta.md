3. Fry in some olive oil until lightly browned on the skin side
4. Add a little bit of salt and pepper, and squish the tomatoes
5. Optionally add a little bit of:
   1. beef / chicken stock
   2. tomato paste
   3. anchovy paste
   4. chili flakes
   5. oregano (suggested by github copilot)
   6. finely diced shallot
6. When almost ready, add torn fresh basil leaves
   1. Must be fresh
   2. Torn to avoid bruising and browning
7. Add the pasta (and some pasta water) and stir to coat
   1. Avoid adding salt in case this is too salty
